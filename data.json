APIs are a technology that allows firms to interact and share information with other firms at an unprecedented scale, taking advantage of the far-reaching progress in digitization and the rising influence of software in our day-to-day lives. The skyrocketing valuations of companies (see recent unicorns such as Uber ) that excel in exploiting APIs demonstrate the modern-day power of informational assets. By incorporating APIs in their strategies, many other firms can follow in their footsteps. Every firm can use its customer touchpoints to collect information using software systems. Telecom operators also have the opportunity to exploit API access into their systems. The idea of API enablement might sound \u201ctech-y,\u201d but it is important for executives at telecom operators and service providers to understand the potential of a market that could be worth billions of dollars per year. APIs may well be the next killer app that telcos have been looking for \u2013 essentially making it easy for their own internal teams and for external partners to access their network systems, to easily create new revenue-generating services. It is an idea a few major telecom operators are now coming to grips with. Yet there are many telecom operators that have not moved API development and there are many technological, financial and cultural reasons for the slow rate of movement. Operators that do not embrace the idea of exposing APIs will be slower to market than their rivals, miss great collaboration opportunities with the internet developer community and fail to open up some great revenue-generating opportunities. The good news is they don\u2019t have to do it all themselves. A range of vendors have moved into the market with systems that are designed to support carriers in widespread exposure of APIs. SightCall\u2019s service provides telcos the APIs and Mobile SDKs they need to create a consistent Web communication experience across major browsers and mobile platforms. A large set of features is made available to them, including (but not limited to) one-to-one audio and video calling as well as group conferencing and screen-sharing. The wide flexibility of the API allows them to create customized experiences. For example, a remote diagnosis application might start a video call using only one-way video from the back camera of a smartphone. Such an application would allow a remote person to see what the person holding the smartphone is showing \u201clive\u201d in real-time. SightCall has its own video Platform as a Service (PaaS) to ensure a global quality of service around the world and can also be integrated quickly into existing Telco Data Centers. When partnering with SightCall, Telcos can quickly offer new innovative services to their customers and capture new revenue opportunities.

Accenture\u2019s remote-support offering is a smartphone application that enables a fast, high-quality and secure video communication between a mobile operator on the aircraft and support experts in the back office. Using SightCall\u2019s video technology, the offering enables the expert in the back office to clearly understand the issue and then guide the mobile operator through a resolution quickly and securely. This helps Airbus improve operations through faster decision-making and less non-productive time, ultimately lowering assembly costs. Historically when an issue was detected, email, photos and other forms of media shared to highlight and resolve the problem were asynchronous. As a result, the time to react to the issue increased. Accenture\u2019s remote-support now allows workers to simply click a button to reach the right person for expert help immediately, eliminating the need to spend time travelling between locations. \u201cWe look forward to continuing to innovate and deliver new solutions that help aerospace manufacturers improve productivity and reduce costs,\u201d said Julio Juan Prieto, a managing director for Accenture\u2019s Aerospace and Defense practice. About Accenture Accenture is a leading global professional services company, providing a broad range of services and solutions in strategy, consulting, digital, technology and operations.

They greet us when we browse websites, assist us when we give verbal commands to our smart devices, upsell us when we shop online and direct us when we contact customer support. Business Insider experts predict that by 2020, 80% of enterprises will be using chatbots. So what exactly is a chatbot? In short, a chatbot is computer software that has been designed to interact intelligently with humans online. The bot is programmed to take cues from human conversations and using language association it can produce instructions, documentation, and general guidance. Despite the common misconception that chatbots and artificial intelligence are here to take our jobs, they actually alleviate mundane tasks and make companies more performant. Chatbots can also improve the way we approach the future of work in field service. Most field service organizations operate in saturated markets where the key to success hinges on competitive differentiation and great customer service. Chatbots can help support a robust customer service initiative by automating simple processes without losing the level of human interaction that customers require for a positive experience. A survey conducted by Spiceworks showed that 40% of large companies employing more than 500 people plan to implement one or more intelligent assistant or AI-based chat robots over corporate mobile devices in 2019. Here are just a few of the added benefits that chatbots and artificial intelligence can add to your field service organization. 1) Chatbot Automation Cuts Down on Service Calls Chatbots make it possible for customers and technicians to resolve their own issues in real-time by accessing tutorials, step-by-step instructions, or automated directions to place orders for replacement parts. With a chatbot as the first line of defense in resolving routine service issues, it\u2019s possible for your service agents to spend more time resolving high-value tickets. 2) Chatbots Can Quickly Scale Your Service Department Chatbots are like automated employees that can work without breaks, holidays, or sleep! They can handle multiple customers at one time while alleviating your human resources from mundane tasks. Bots make it possible to scale through digital transformation without hiring more employees to perform the same set of tasks. 3) Chatbots Integrate with your Field Service Management (FSM) tool Chatbots reduce the time a customer spends on hold by making it simple for them to book service requests that push directly to your FSM. By going online to request technical support, the customer or technician can transition with ease through an automated process that doesn\u2019t require actual human interference until a technician receives the request to visit the customer site. When the chatbot is connected to your FSM, a solid record of all customer transactions is built, giving you fast and easy access to important KPIs, and helping your AI to become smarter and more refined. 4) Chatbots Increase Service Availability Outside of Routine Hours It\u2019s not always possible for companies to offer the same level of support on a 24/7/365 schedule. With a chatbot, you\u2019re able to greet and triage technical support issues at any time. If the issue needs to be transferred to a human agent, that agent will move more quickly towards resolution, because the chat transcript has been automatically transferred to their CRM. With less repetition and downtime, the overall experience is more positive and efficient for the customer or technician, and the agent. 5) Chatbots Help Automate Field Service Requests Traditionally chatbots are used for customer self-service, but in field service, they can support technicians in the field. SightCall Video Assistance Chatbot for Salesforce is an example of a chatbot that can be used as a resource to help technicians when they are having issues resolving a service order. The technician can be guided by the bot to proper documentation and problem resolution, or they can request immediate visual support from a remote expert that can use Augmented Reality and Artificial Intelligence insights to guide them towards an immediate fix, reducing downtime and the need for additional truck rolls.

IoT changes Business models \u2013 How to adapt support models consequently? SightCall A significant and often overlooked impact of IoT is how it can transform the support revenue model into a usage-based pricing model. Selling a product as a service rather than simply as a product has created a wonderful opportunity for manufacturers to receive recurring and predictable revenues. There is however a dark side to support. The welcome recurring fees also imply a recurring level of support. When the ceramic pot holding my plant broke, I went to the store and I bought a new ceramic pot. With IoT, my new connected pot sends an alert when the dirt has become too dry because my watering has leaked out of the crack in the pot. What do I do with my connected pot? Well, I expect the vendor to fix the pot. This is not a new problem; multiple industries already deliver recurring support today. The new variable elements are volume and price. In traditional industries, when you call customer service, you are either asked to return the product for a replacement or wait for a technician to come to repair it. Does the traditional model work for my new connected pot? Companies managing high volumes of returns have a living nightmare. Their handling, testing, refurbishing and restocking efforts collectively are activities they would prefer to avoid. In addition, customer expectations have been changed by free return offers from Amazon and some other big brands. A single dispatch of a repair technician would cost the company more than the price of my pot. And it is clear that none of these solutions, despite their high price will prevent my plant dying. This raises the question \u2026 is there an alternative to a costly return or technician dispatch? SightCall Visual Support provides support agents the ability to see what your customers see and enables them to provide live guidance to their customers for problem resolution, using their customers\u2019 mobile. To learn more, watch the video to see how: https://youtu.be/I5LeF8jYlgI The good news is that the feedback from the customers is amazing. More than 85% are willing to use their mobile phone to help solving a problem, since they see a path to a quick resolution. One of my favorite quotes came from a customer who had contacted an agent using SightCall Visual Support: \u201cThe service you provided with is even better than the product I bought\u201d.

For Salesforce users, these enterprises are not looking to completely overhaul the way they do things with their CRM system, only to make them better. Most visual assistance tools on the market satisfy only a limited number of needs while still leaving room for improvement. Their users describe a number of \u201cnice-to-haves\u201d that would vastly improve output and productivity. Users may experience video calls with clients or technicians who have a spotty picture or poor connectivity, making it difficult to solve an issue. There may be multiple steps involved in transferring data from the virtual session to Salesforce, forcing an agent to use disparate systems and discouraging adoption. If a company operates across continents and borders, it may also be concerned about the portability of virtual solutions due to compliance with data regulation and privacy laws. So, what makes SightCall different than the average video tool on the market? To us, these features and customer concerns are not mere nice-to-haves \u2013 they are considered the essentials that represent the future of enterprise-grade visual assistance solutions. Salesforce possesses built-in chat, text, email and voice features, but does not have video capability of its own. Enter SightCall, a fully integrated platform with minimal setup time that provides AR and AI-driven virtual assistance as an extension and augmentation of the Salesforce Omnichannel. Full and unfettered integration means that high-definition video sessions can be set up and managed through the Salesforce console. For instance, when a customer approaches a business to help with a product issue, a support agent can launch a SightCall session with the click of a button inside the console, sending an SMS link to the session and walking the customer through the solution remotely. The agent can employ tools like telestration, or pointer, drawing directions or diagrams on the screen the customer can see and follow. They can turn on the customer\u2019s iPhone flashlight remotely, to give another example. The agent is also able to screen share what they see or share to an app and link with the customer through this feature. Businesses find they are able to maximize their resources by handling numerous inquiries without stepping out into the field, with the added benefits of an 81% increase in first-time fixes, a 69% decrease in issue resolution time, and technician training time almost halved. The administrative benefits are even greater. Consider a Data Warehousing Institute study, which estimates that bad, inaccurate or missing data costs American businesses some $600 billion every year. Clerical errors and inaccuracies have a tangible negative impact, and companies without clear recordkeeping methods are at a clear disadvantage to competitors for strategy and growth. Two SightCall features help remedy this problem. On a virtual assistance call with a customer, a user can employ the Smart Optical Character Recognition feature to capture text, read barcodes or QR codes and immediately transfer the data to their Salesforce file, entirely eliminating manual transcription and the errors that can come with it. AR Smart Measure performs a similar function, accurately capturing a surface area between two points the user traces with their finger, without the need for a manual ruler and with the ability to instantly feed the data back to the customer file. Accentuating these features is a high level of compliance with data regulation and privacy laws, both at home and around the world.

Then much later, in fact, some 3.5 millennia later the catalyst occurred creating modern insurance; several years after the 1666 Great Fire of London in 1680, awareness for better protection of the homeowners was formulated for the first time. Many years have passed and for more than 80% of homeowners reported damage, a field adjuster must visit the home site to see the damage and evaluate the cost for the repair. The 21st-century digital insurance In a mobile-first, self-service economy many 21st-century insurance companies introduced new services allowing their customers to fill in an online form, whether using a mobile app or using a paper form to be scan/fax returned, to describe their damage. With the collected information, an insurer can analyze the claim and provide an estimate for the repairs covered by the insurance company. After several experiments and live deployments, carriers identified the limits of the self-service process. A majority of the carriers working with SightCall report that this \u201casynchronous\u201d service, in which a customer sends information to the carrier which is then considered by the carrier who then replies several days later, has reached its limits. In fact, these carriers have identified that damages over $500 have a risk profile too high for self-service handling. The risk stems from the fraud factor and the accuracy of the collected information. Regarding fraud, a top-three global insurance carrier reported that \u201cwhen they receive the same Google image as proof of damage over 10 times during the same day, they were more than just irritated\u201d. As far as accuracy, most carriers know that their customers don\u2019t have the skills to accurately capture photos including clear views of the actual damage in order to perform an estimate. Customers may try their best but in most cases, the insurer requires additional information to complete the claim. As a result in 2017, more than 80% of filed claims require an onsite visit with an average claim process duration of 3 weeks. This is where AR-powered live video comes to improve the process by replacing onsite visits with a remote video assessment. The insurer connects via a live video session with the insured to collect the evidence required to complete the claim. The desk adjuster is in control and can perform their job as if they were onsite. Actually, even better than being on site because all of the information (pictures, annotations\u2026) is immediately saved into the claims management system. With this optimization, the claims process can be reduced from 3 weeks to a few hours. When digital meets human Several industries demonstrated have that self-service went too far and have reacted by re-engaging in a \u201creal human\u201d interaction with their customers. Now consider a crisis situation, such as when there is a water leak in the kitchen. A customer may become impatient speaking to a robot or an Artificial Intelligence engine; in fact, it may be perceived by the customer as poor rather than great customer service. Whereas today bots are great to collect initial information based on several standard questions. A natural evolution now available is an integration of such chatbots and live video assistance, and thereby providing a very interesting combination of automatic questions/answers and live human interaction escalation which can be seamless in the conversation stream. With technology and an evolution of consumer behavior, the frontier between artificial and human interaction is evolving. It is clear that there are many interesting evolutions in this space ahead. A couple of software vendors as SightCall are currently experimenting with Augmented Reality to streamline the claims process with 3D guidance on top of the physical world. For now, leading insurers including Axa, Allianz, AG Insurance, American Family, to name only a few beginning with an \u201cA\u201d, have engaged in the transformation with Augmented Reality Video Assistance. Results are instantaneous: Customers love it. The NPS results are reaching their highest level and the cost reductions are phenomenal. Replacing a $200 to $500 onsite visit and post-treatment with a live video with the customer is cost-cutting by up to 80%.

This daily program (airing Monday through Friday) allows the consumer to decipher the marketing codes, with the support of a team of columnists who are interviewing the guest, so that the information they possess about a specific topic is not misled. Eric Renders has 3 minutes to explain the video claim expertise service launched by AG Insurance, powered by SightCall. In those rapid three minutes, Renders manages to brush over key facts of how Sightcall has revolutionized the repair and maintenance profession, not only by aiding many companies like AG Insurance but also by \u201chelping customers save time.\u201d You can review the video here: https://youtu.be/ozWNoe0ulfI English transcript version of the interview: This marks the end of the era of expertise by \u2018flesh and blood\u2019 and begins the era of expertise through smartphones. Eric Renders from AG Insurance is here today to tell us more about it. Mr. Renders hello and welcome. We could\u2019ve met by Skype but the best is to meet to talk about it. We will see how it works but now, in the case of a disaster we can now have a live expert through a smartphone and an application like Skype or FaceTime point is that correct? That is quite right. To go to the details of this technological advance, I leave you in the hands of Anne Laure. You have 3 minutes to explain all this, Let\u2019s go! Good Evening, we already talked about the principle, with this new app, we now are able to live with an expert, we can also record videos and take pictures through this app. Is that correct? \u2013Yes. Let\u2019s go, we have 3 minutes. With your video expertise application, it is like having a Skype, Sebastien mentioned it, so what is the added value? The added value is not only having a Skype, it is the fact that the expert from his desk, can now control his customer\u2019s tablet or smartphone, to be able to guide and tell him, what he needs to show or zoom in. He is really guiding the customer through the camera of his smartphone. So the Customer is going to participate, he is going to have to work, don\u2019t you think? I don\u2019t think so\u2026 It\u2019s just like having the expert home with the customer, guiding him through the rooms of his house, showing where the damages are, and instead of showing with his hand only, he is going to use his smartphone to complement his hand and speech. Ok\u2026 You are going to save money with this application, your experts won\u2019t go visit anymore, you save time so might need fewer experts, therefore, are you going to lower your prices? Let me tell you first why we did that. 4,000 customers through all the insurance companies were asked what was important for them, what should be done to manage their claim well? The first responses were that it has to be fast and easy. We cannot really say we are going to save money. We will be able to do more expertise in less time, but on the other hand, we still have to pay for the app, so in the end, costs are the same for AG Insurance. Our goal is really to help customers to save time. So, those customers who want to go fast, know how to use these new technologies, are young customers, don\u2019t you think you are going to lose the confidence of your older customers with this type of application? I don\u2019t think so\u2026 We offer this application in addition. The 3 or 4 existing other ways to claim damage, still exist and for those who want it, the broker or the customer, they call us and we offer the possibility to do video expertise. If they don\u2019t want to, we go back to the traditional way of an expert visiting the customer. But within 2 or 3 weeks only we already have had claims at AG Insurance where, within an hour, the video-expertise had been completed and the customer was fully satisfied. Does your application work for all claims? Robbery, water damage, fire?\u2026 So this is not valid in case of robberies, we have to check for visible damages on the spot, people often show pictures of what was stolen, and it\u2019s not possible through a smartphone\u2019s app, on the other hand, we estimated it could work for 80% of other claims. But it has to fit in several other criteria, when another Insurance company is involved, if AG Insurance is the only user of the app, it won\u2019t work either. How do you verify that the customer who claims damage is at home and not at his neighbor\u2019s? We trust our customers, but we do ask to activate their geolocation to see where they are at the time of the expertise. So there is a check on that\u2026 Yes, and in most cases, our broker is there to assist us on that matter. Please join the table for a small debriefing. Questions? Xavier? Annie? Yes, we all know that an image can be deceptive, e.g. we all look good on TV but in real life\u2026(laughs). Don\u2019t you think this is going to give a misleading image of the damages and minimize them, whereas a visual contact, would allow detecting more damages? Well, customers are connected to real experts; it\u2019s not me or anybody, they know their job and will be able to tell if more material is needed to claim the damage. And also, in most cases, a broker is there to help his customer, which is important, he will point important things out, he is an Insurance professional, and in the end, if the customer is not ok with the estimate, we are still in discussion\u2026 I have a simple question, so\u2026 a claim is now solved quicker, no need to wait for weeks anymore, let\u2019s say the claim is done, the customer got reimbursed for the damages, but it went so fast that we forgot something, we can see further damages, and that was not expected, can you reopen the file? We can always reopen the file; we already do it on regular cases. The only thing we change here is that instead of a real person on the spot, we now have someone holding a smartphone. I think it is a good idea, today you already see experts coming to your house with their tablet and barely out of your house, you already know how much you have to pay for the repairs. Everything works like that nowadays. So now, you are offering this new service, but you are not the only Insurance Company on the move, it is really a great tool and everyone will follow for sure!

Without a doubt, I answered the telecom industry. Most people would certainly agree as even comedians find cable companies an easy target for a joke about poor service. Although telecom providers get a bad rap on customer service satisfaction, to be fair it isn\u2019t an easy task to be the backbone of our connected lives. I can only imagine the high volume of complaints received by their contact centers daily. As a result, when a major player in this industry introduces a breakthrough in customer service innovation, it doesn\u2019t take long for their peers to take notice and plan their own copycat version. Verizon Introduces Live Video Support Recently, Verizon Fios introduced such innovation by providing their customer support agents with a video support capability. Enabling customer representatives with \u201crep guidance\u201d tools is part of the strategic customer experience initiative described by Tami Erwin, Vice President of National Operations in this Forbes\u2019 interview. In an effort to promote this new customer experience, Verizon hired John McEnroe, a former American World No. 1 professional tennis player to play the role of a frustrated customer who tries to get started with his Verizon set-top box. If you\u2019ve never seen John McEnroe outside a tennis court, here is your chance: Live Video Support Helps Agents and Customers to Help Each Other As demonstrated in this video, whenever hardware is involved in a support request, there is clear justification to provide video support tools to customer support reps. By seeing the connections on the back of Mr. McEnroe\u2019s set-top box, the agent could immediately understand the problem. There was a cable connected to the wrong connector and the agent was able to guide Mr. McEnroe to reconnect the cable correctly. This type of request would have been challenging to resolve with text chat or voice only. Adding live video support has not only reduced the time required for an agent to diagnose a problem, but has also enabled Mr. McEnroe\u2019s request to be resolved during the first call. Beyond cost savings, Verizon shows us how a great customer service experience can turn an angry customer into an advocate. First-contact resolution is an important customer service KPI in most industries as customers\u2019 discontentment often originates from the many repeated interactions required to solve a technical issue. Here, the Verizon example teaches us that trivial technical problems can be solved at first contact with the help of live video assistance.

Your TV does not find the channels You cannot setup your new phone with your provider\u2019s services After several hours on communities you decide to chat with an agent who offers you to do things that you already did 3 times to restore the service. You take the decision to call and you know will have to go through a painful IVR before getting to an agent who will ask you to do the same things over again\u2026 The great news is that telcos are embracing the Visual Support video wave. Right from your community, chat or phone call discussions can be escalated to a live video session where you can collaborate with an agent who can see and immediately understand your problem. Thomas Cottereau, SightCall\u2019s CEO was invited to present how telcos can benefit from SightCall\u2019s Real-Time Communication Platform. He explains that \u201cit is not about seeing a person as you do with FaceTime, it is more about seeing the problem and help the customer solving it\u201d. After the insurance and retail industries, the telecom industry is leveraging the SightCall platform to provide the most efficient and cost-effective customer service while providing a better customer experience. If improving customer service and reducing its overall cost are top priorities for your organization, let\u2019s think out of the box and consider how a short video interaction can be worth 100,000 words on a forum, a chat or a voice call.

The field service industry is experiencing fundamental changes in their interaction and interfaces that are making their past systems and processes obsolete. These changes come from the evolution of the way humans interact with data and machines. The past two decades have demonstrated how quickly humans can develop new machines and adapt to them. We quickly conditioned ourselves to keyboards and then touch screens to start, while the quickly-approaching future will rely heavily on augmented and virtual realities. I watch my 15-year-old son do his homework, and it highlights this technological evolution. His smartphone and laptop have replaced the books, paper, and pen that I used as a child. Homework assignments are now done online. Google and YouTube have replaced library books; Snapchat is used to instantly compare results with his friends. As these technologies permeate our daily lives, the workplace will only become increasingly complex. For the field service industry, where technicians are tasked with repairing machinery amidst rapid technological advancements, this complexity can present a myriad of challenges. In 2015, The Service Council surveyed field service industry professionals to identify the challenges that they are facing. They highlighted that 70% of the field service professionals envisioned an outflow of experienced field service talent leading to: The loss of their knowledge and expertise The loss of their connections and relationships with customers The loss of their work ethic and reliability Of that 70% in Chart 1, one-half are dealing with a retiring workforce now, while another half expect to face the challenges associated with a retiring workforce in the next 5-10 years. In 2017, The Service Council prepared another survey named, \u201c A Sustainable Field Service Workforce: The Service Council\u2019s Guide to Successfully Navigating the Retirement Crisis.\u201d Here we learned: There is a looming talent crisis in the field service industry due to a large retiring workforce and insufficient incoming workforce Dispatch-less service models will reduce the overall field service burden, but won\u2019t eliminate the need for new field service talent To solve the talent crisis organizations must align their business, workforce, and technology strategies Key Data Points (Percentage of Respondents) 70% are concerned about the knowledge loss from a retiring field workforce 52% plan to address the aging workforce challenge by developing a succession planning regimen for field service 52% are looking to introduce mentorship programs to help connect their multigenerational workforces 58% believe that an aging workforce will drive interest in Augmented Reality technology How Can the Field Service Industry Counter Workforce Issues? Under the weight of these challenges, we must be creative when imagining how an organization might adapt in order to maintain or even increase efficiency. Even if IoT and AI help diagnose and automate standard flow routines in field service, technicians\u2019 days are made of new circumstances and permanent adaption to an infinite variety of environments. As a result, we must think critically about how to digitally transform field service environments to adapt to the increasing pressures facing the industry. I believe that leveraging augmented reality and video is key to addressing these ever-changing realities, regardless of the complexity and uniqueness of the scenario. Think of the three common factors that compose every field service call: maintenance to perform someone on-site to perform actions specific skills and knowledge that are required to perform appropriate actions If we take these factors and integrate augmented reality and remote video assistance, suddenly our issues can be addressed by having someone on-site other than our specifically trained and experienced field technician. This person could be a younger technician, a crowd-sourced technician, or even the customer. With AR-powered video assistance, we know that a technician can successfully perform maintenance with an 81% chance of increased first-time-fix, while easily accessing any new knowledge and guidance that is required to perform their job. Using a smartphone, this same guidance can be provided to a crowd-sourced technician or a customer. Below, I have outlined three models where the use of AR-powered video assistance can transform the way an organization approaches field service, by successfully empowering the person on-site. Augmented Reality Empowered Field Technicians For field service organizations expecting a talent crisis associated with the loss of knowledge and expertise, developing centralized expertise centers is a straightforward solution. Service organizations can optimize the use of their most talented experts by making them available to help field technicians remotely. These rare resources can help by fixing the most complex situations faced by techs in the field every day, regardless of where they happen. Several organizations, such as Terex, Bosch, and Valeo created centralized expertise centers using the power of Augmented Reality. Click their names to see video examples of how they have digitally transformed their organizations. Another thing we learned, while working with field organizations, is that knowledge is not always centralized. This is what some organizations call \u201ctribal knowledge.\u201d In these scenarios, Bob cannot repair a very specific machine, but remembers that Jim can help. These situations are common, and although they usually lead to good success rates, they are sometimes criticized by management for 2 main reasons: It is not efficient to use two technicians on site, and disturbing another technician for long discussions impacts timing for both. When a second technician must come to handle a repair, their knowledge is not shared and capitalized on by the organization. Several organizations including Mapfre have equipped their field forces with AR-powered video apps to provide technicians with the ability to help guide each other in an efficient way (a picture is worth 1,000 words) while capturing the knowledge. Now, Bob can call Jim through the app, and Jim can use live video to walk Bob through the repair, providing him with on-the-job training and increased knowledge. Augmented Reality to Leverage \u201cThe Crowd\u201d We often hear about the \u201cuberisation\u201d of field service. At the heart of the Uber service is that technology allows you to track orders, service, location, delivery, ratings and involve a community of independent workers by using your smartphone. Moving the field service industry toward an operating environment in which an Uber-like business model will be possible is a complex move requiring a lot of considerations. Most importantly, you must be structured on a platform that\u2019s flexible and configurable, able to quickly facilitate the delivery of your services, like Uber. A few players have proposed on-the-shelf solutions, helping to navigate this transformation. Coresystems has pioneered \u201ccrowd service\u201d \u2013 which allows customers to leverage an Uber-like platform to find available field service technicians in real-time. One of the core questions that every field service executive will highlight while considering this model relates to skills and knowledge. These are core pillars of a successful service organization. It\u2019s one thing to be fast, but another thing to be competent and fix the problem the first time. This is where Augmented Reality-powered Video Assistance comes into play. It\u2019s easy to empower a crowd technician to perform a task correctly when you have the ability to leverage live assistance from an expert who can see and guide them remotely. While it may be a bit premature to provide metrics about an \u201cuberised\u201d field service model, we are preparing for its eventual adoption! Augmented Reality to Leverage \u201cThe Customer\u201d Last but not least, the third model involves the customer in the maintenance and repair loop. While this is not always possible, it should be seriously considered \u2013 especially now that the proper tools exist for facilitating a customer-involved repair. Today, most organizations operate in silos. Field service and customer service are separate parts of an organization with different processes and metrics. What if we bought the success and learning that we\u2019ve had in the customer service organization to field service? Watch this customer support video done in a BT contact center in the UK. Customer service agents save technician dispatches every week, by guiding the customer to the resolution of their problem using AR video assistance on their smartphones. A great majority of field service industry leaders still believe that their customers are not tech-savvy and are not ready to be part of the maintenance and repair chain. They think that they consider this to be the job of a technician. Interesting fact: Insurance claims leaders once thought the same. When they experimented with SightCall, they learned otherwise. When customers were asked, \u201cWould you like to make an appointment for a field adjuster to come to see the damage? Or if you have a smartphone, would you be willing to show me the damage via live video?\u201d an average of more than 90% of customers chose video for a faster resolution. By asking this question, Allianz field adjusters were saved from driving more than 6 million kilometers last year. Another fascinating fact revealed by the survey proposed to the customers at the end of the video session is the strong increase in Net Promoter Score (NPS). As an average, the NPS score of the customers who benefitted from the remote video expertise is 30 points higher than those who had to wait for a technician dispatch. Prepare Your Field Service Organization for the Future The tools that you need to prepare your organization for a mixed reality future are already here. Now, it\u2019s up to you to take the first step. Regardless of the model that works best for you, experience is the best teacher. With that in mind, here are a few lessons we\u2019ve learned along the way as we\u2019ve helped clients implement digital transformations: Identify all areas of opportunity where AR could make an impact Identify measurable metrics that define success for your organization Align yourself with a partner that is interested in helping you succeed. Involve all levels of employees in piloting \u2013 this leads to higher adoption Try! Don\u2019t be afraid of being a change-maker in your organization.

Their failure is the result of insurance companies not engaging with their customers. There are typically three events when insurance companies communicate with their customers: When a customer opens a new policy When a customer files a claim When a customer cancels their policy and signs with a competitor Each of these events is critical to the relationship. Today there are many cost comparison websites claiming to find the best price for insurance. In this post, I will focus my comments on the second event. This is the event that we hope will not come but is the reason why we pay an ongoing fee for insurance, to help us recover from an accident or loss. Just consider that when you pay several hundred dollars periodically for insurance, it is similar in some ways to put that money into a piggy bank. And, the day of the emergency, I really just want to break the piggy bank and take out my money to replace the damage. But, what actually happens with most insurance policies is that you have to explain, justify, and demonstrate that you really had a loss and need this money to cover the damage. The insurance corporations don\u2019t just trust you. They require that an \u201cexpert\u201d must come to your place or to see your car or home to perform an estimate. The estimation is not friendly; the estimator doesn\u2019t want to discuss the accident or the claim or hear about the value of a beloved car or carpet. He is the expert who will tell you its value. Think about the last time you filed a claim for some damage to your car or home. You most likely had to call your agent, who was friendly and made some notes about the loss. Then, a day or two passed and you were contacted by the adjuster who needed some additional information. Of course, the missing information required you to repeat what you told your agent when you had filed the claim initially. No, you are not done yet; the adjuster then makes an appointment to see the damage. Of course, you will need to have someone available to open the door (or the car) and show him the damage. More time passes and you finally receive the estimate which is not the amount you had expected. After a week of pain (best case), you can now get a repair technician to start the repair! So think about a variation on this scenario; instead of having to arrange a time to meet the adjuster to see the damage in person, what if you could show the damage live using your mobile phone, the same day? Just imagine that he could capture all of the information including pictures directly during your video session. This eliminates the need for an on-site appointment with an adjuster. The simplicity and time savings are amazing. But, there was one interesting revelation from a SightCall customer last week. I was surprised when I heard that the biggest value from live video claims was not found in the time and money-saving. He told me \u201cthe main benefit of your solution is the customer engagement in the claim process. Now that our customers are part of the estimate, they can show what they believe is important. And, by being involved they are not surprised by the estimate, are much happier, and are significantly less likely to dispute the estimate.\u201d Don\u2019t Let Years of Wisdom Walk Out the Door Connect with us today to build a plan for capturing knowledge and reducing revenue loss Get a Demo Get Connected!

Participating in the success of digital video transformation for global insurance carriers like Allianz, AG Insurance, and AXA, I have seen firsthand how this question can be answered. The aforementioned carriers have completely transformed the way they interact with millions of customers from FNOL to repair by embracing video technology. Today, video technology designed for integrating remote expertise capabilities is mature and proven. In the last year alone, over 100,000 unique users connected to the SightCall remote video assistance platform to assess claims, provide technical expertise, perform remote video inspections, or simply see what the customer sees. We see that InsurTech platforms are being accepted at a rapid pace by European carriers and customers, while the U.S. falls behind. In interviews with over 20 National Claims Directors, we learned that some implementations are failing due to a lack of following the fundamental steps that are required in digital video transformation, and fear that their customers are not ready. In May 2018, SightCall conducted a survey and found that an overwhelming amount of U.S. consumers are indeed ready for digital change. 68% of respondents would like for their insurance company to give them the option to choose between a video assessment or onsite claim and 22% answered maybe. This is a total of 90% of customers open to video claims. In this same population, 59% believe that an immediate remote video assessment is the ideal way to file a claim, and 37% would rather schedule an appointment for a video or in-person assessment. Only 5% of them expressed that they would prefer a chatbot interaction. 69% also report having never been given the option to file a claim using a photo or video. If the consumers are ready, it is up to the insurance companies to listen and provide an adequate solution. The challenge is now to overcome the transformation of the claims process and the way insurance, third-party adjusters, and independent adjusters work. SightCall is pleased to release our new white paper, Digital Video Transformation for Insurers \u2013 Successfully Implement Live Video into the Claims Process, sharing the best practices and lessons learned along the road to claims transformation using remote video to replace onsite claims assessments.

Besides all of the minuscule things that distract us such as coffee breaks, talkative coworkers and social media sites, meetings have become one of the most unproductive formalities during the work day. Even keeping complete focus during a meeting is borderline impossible with 90% of all employees saying that they daydream at some point during every meeting. One of the biggest reasons that meetings tend to be so unproductive is that there are simply too many of them each day. It is reported that there are over 11 Million formal meetings per day in the United States \u2013 that\u2019s over 3 Billion meetings per year. Besides the fact that most people say that they can\u2019t pay attention during these meetings, 71% of those that do feel like the meeting is unproductive. So how do you stay more productive during the work day? Easy, avoid your next meeting. There are many reasons why meetings are a huge time suck and productivity waster. Regardless of the fact that the action item being discussed during the meeting could have easily been accomplished through email, the meeting still happens. What\u2019s even worse is that 63% of typical meetings in the United States don\u2019t have a prepared agenda which leads to about 25% of meetings discussing irrelevant things. Worse yet, your hour wasn\u2019t the only hour wasted. Think of it like this: if you show up for an hour long meeting with four others and nothing of significance gets done that isn\u2019t just one hour wasted \u2013 it is FIVE hours wasted. You and the four others just wasted one hour each; and that\u2019s only counting the actual minutes spent sitting in the room and not the time it took to \u201cprepare\u201d, get everyone in the room, and send out/reply to follow ups. Besides turning this into a full blown rant about wasted time, here are some alternatives to formal meetings that will keep your productivity level high. Video Calling Have you ever needed to set up an impromptu meeting because you need an answer from someone at that very moment? For example, you have a huge presentation this afternoon with a potential client or board members and you need some data from Sue who has been working on this project with you for months. Sue is obviously slammed and doesn\u2019t have time to make a formal meeting. You\u2019re both in front of your computers so what do you do?With one click of a button you can start a video call with Sue and discuss the action items at hand so you can get ready to kill it during this presentation. But what if Sue isn\u2019t 100 percent sure about the answers she is giving you? With certain video calling integrations you can instantly bring in John who has also been working on the project. Within five minutes you have your answer and you\u2019re ready to move forward with the work that is actually important. Better yet, no one had to leave their office or spend more time than necessary in the meeting. The value from video calling capability on an enterprise level is sometimes overlooked. The future of increased productivity and enterprise collaboration across all departments with mass adoption of real time video, screen share and file sharing is something we all are looking forward to. Email I know what you\u2019re thinking and yes, email can definitely be a major distraction during the work day. But if you limit the amount of times you check email throughout the day you can manage your productivity significantly. Tim Ferris, in his New York Best Selling Book \u201cThe Four Hour Work Week\u201d recommends checking your email only twice a day and never before 10AM. Low priority meetings can be avoided by simply starting an email thread. This allows the information to be transferred to the responsible parties and participants can respond at appropriate times so that interruptions and ultimately productivity drop offs don\u2019t occur. Frankly, the first 20 or 30 minutes of each meeting is sometimes the \u201clet me get you up to speed\u201d part of the meeting where data, which could have easily been shared through email prior to the meeting, is finally being regurgitated from the mouths of your coworkers who probably don\u2019t want to be there just as much as you don\u2019t. So next time please don\u2019t send the calendar invite, send the email. Walking Meetings Probably the least traditional of any of the alternatives listed here is having a meeting that gets you outside. There are a lot of good reasons to make your next meeting a walking meeting. Fresh air and physical activity stimulate our bodies and minds which makes us more alert and focused. How many times have you needed to get some \u201cfresh air\u201d after being inside for most of the day? Probably a lot. Walking burns calories which increases the flow of oxygen throughout the body increasing brain function. Next, a change of environment can inspire creative thinking and new ideas. These types of meetings can be extremely effective as brainstorming sessions and don\u2019t worry about the ability to take notes. Nolifer Merchant gave a great TED Talk about why getting outside and having a walking meeting might actually save our lives. You can see her talk here. Even though avoiding your next meeting will increase your productivity by 3,000% (not a scientifically proven number) it is sometimes difficult to break through the traditional way business is run. If all else fails and you are still trying to avoid the next meeting \u2013 so that you can get work done that is actually important \u2013 try using the three alternative solutions we just mentioned so that your time is effectively utilized.

Neither of these statements is true, so keep reading. We\u2019ll walk you through the basics of AR, as well as how it can be applied to customer and field service use cases. At SightCall, we believe that transformative technologies, like AR, must be bridges to innovation and not barriers. We\u2019ve developed an AR-powered video platform that is easy to integrate, adopt, and apply for immediate ROI. AR Integration without the Costly Overhead AR is a technology that imposes computer-generated images onto the reality in front of us, providing new context, instructions or enhancements to the things we are viewing in real-time. AR is being used all around us and has been present for at least 20 years. Especially prevalent during sporting events, you may have noticed AR in the Summer Olympics, when it\u2019s used to identify swimmers in their lanes. On cell phones, AR is a popular feature in Snapchat for users to put a fun, interactive filter on their photos. At retail, home improvement suppliers are using AR technology to help you visualize your living space with a fresh coat of paint. If you still believe AR is the future, the future has arrived. Today, nearly all companies are working on a way to integrate AR into their technical processes. Often this requires glasses or headsets that can be costly, requiring training, maintenance, and deployment. While these tools are effective, they can only be applied internally and have many limitations. SightCall was early to join the wearable AR trend, back when the first version of the Google Glass was released in 2012. Since then, we have continued to invest in optimizing software and wearables user experiences with several platforms. Despite interest in wearable AR, adoption in the field is low, with few people having access to these services. To remove barriers to adoption, SightCall\u2019s AR technology takes advantage of a tool your employees and customers already own \u2013 a smartphone. This allows companies of any size to deploy Augmented Reality across their organization within an easy-to-use app environment. Augmented Reality wearables and glasses show slow growth but are projected to increase in coming years[/caption] AR as Tool to Transform the Customer Experience There are two common themes among all of SightCall\u2019s clients \u2013 innovation and customer satisfaction. Each company we work with cares about finding innovative technologies that will benefit their customers by transforming the way they interact. We believe AR is the tool with the most power to disrupt these interactions in a positive way. One example of how AR can change customer experiences is to imagine installing a new cable box in a home. Traditionally, a technician comes to your home to perform this task for you. With SightCall AR, the customer can perform this task alone. They hover their phone camera over the cable box and our app recognizes the cable box, guiding the customer through the installation process by showing each step on their screen. If for any reason the customer cannot complete the task on their own, the app gives them a direct line to contact customer service and initiate a live video call to complete the installation. When used thoughtfully, AR is a tool that can enrich customer experiences and add value to your brand. AR to Support Field Service Technicians In a world powered by the Internet of Things (IoT), our technologies and products are constantly changing. This means that today\u2019s workforce needs modern tools that will help them interact with the constant new challenges that they face in supporting the installation, configuration, diagnosis, and troubleshooting of your products. AR is the next evolution of on-the-job assistance, giving field service technicians and remote experts the ability to see how to resolve a problem, rather than having to thumb through an extensive manual, wait for another technician, or call for help. In one study by General Electric, line-of-sight instructions provided by AR technology improved a worker\u2019s performance by 34% on the first use. As we look at the trend of a growing shortage of skilled manufacturing employees in the workforce, it\u2019s easy to see that AR can be a solution for closing that gap by equipping workers with the on-the-spot guidance they need to complete a task properly the first time. Using SightCall\u2019s AR-powered video assistance, workers can complete tasks that may have previously required a higher skill level, and they can complete them with accuracy. Technicians and agents can also include customers in the process by providing them with remote guidance. This reduces errors, truck rolls, and the time it takes to handle a repair. If workers encounter an issue that the AR feature cannot fix, our SightCall app allows them to contact remote experts to share their experience via video and communicate in real-time to work towards problem resolution. The Future is Here By reimagining how your organization relates to your customers and technicians, there are significant bottom-line values to be gained from AR implementation.

Visual assistance technology is reshaping the way manufacturers interact with their customers. Contact centers are trading confusing IVR menus, frustrating phone calls and endless email exchanges for the clarity of video and intuitive, digital self-service. \u201cSeeing what the customer sees\u201d is giving service organizations new capabilities and context that can supercharge their efficiency. Manufacturers who have tapped into the power of visual assistance are forging a direct, real-time connection with customers, allowing them to troubleshoot issues, provide step-by-step guidance, and enhance the overall support experience. SightCall has been fortunate to work with industry trailblazers who are flipping the switch on traditional support and sparking a customer service revolution! Here\u2019s how SightCall helped transform customer service for three major manufacturers. The Case of the Disappearing Small Talk: How to Lower AHT and Boost FCR with Pre-Call Self-Service Sequences People don\u2019t usually reach out to customer service when things are going well. If an agent and a customer connect, it\u2019s usually to solve a problem. They want help and they want it fast. When someone\u2019s normal routine is upended because the dishwasher isn\u2019t washing dishes or the dryer isn\u2019t drying, all that matters is getting right to the part where you fix what\u2019s wrong. That\u2019s why one of the biggest names in home appliances came to us with a question: How can we get a head start on customer service calls? The Challenge: Reduce Average Handle Time (AHT) and Improve First Call Resolution (FCR) The Fortune 500 appliance manufacturer wanted to make their call center interactions more efficient. Customer service agents were spending too much time per call identifying the person, product, or problem. Sometimes they were even accepting calls from customers who misdialed, had irrelevant questions or were calling about a different brand of appliance altogether! They wanted a better way to deflect the calls that didn\u2019t matter and get right to the point on the calls that did. We helped them create an easier, faster way to collect key information BEFORE launching the human-to-human customer service conversation. The Solution: Empower the Customer with Self-Service Automation What we built for them is a simple, streamlined pre-call experience for collecting key data that gives agents clarity before starting the call. SightCall Digital Flows are a one-click, simple set of digital instructions that customers use to self-submit information. Here\u2019s how it works: A customer who initiates a support request using Live Chat is sent a link to a Digital Flow as an App Clip (no download required). The Digital Flow allows the customer to enter their name, scan the serial number, and state the issue/reason for their call, before engaging with a call center resource\u200b. Once a support agent is ready to start the call, they can do so with contact info and context at hand. The Results: Faster and More Efficient Customer Service SightCall Digital Flows help speed up the customer service process. Beginning with a self-service action eliminates the time that agents would spend collecting preliminary information. Service experts can start working immediately on steps toward resolution. The direct benefits? Reducing call times by 1-2 minutes minimum Improved first-time resolution Higher customer satisfaction (CSAT scores) There are even added layers of efficiency to the company\u2019s customer service stack because SightCall\u2019s Visual Support is always just a click away. Within the same service conversation, customers always have the option of escalating from audio to video. By combining self-service automation with visual support, the company transformed both the customer AND agent experience for the better. RELATED READ: TRANSFORM CALL CENTER EFFICIENCY WITH SELF-SERVICE TRIAGE The Case of the Boomerang Coffee Machines: How to Reduce Product Returns with Visual Engagement When one of the world\u2019s most respected appliance manufacturers creates a luxury line of coffeemakers, the last thing they want is for their machines to come back before customers brew the first espresso. But that\u2019s just what happened. And here\u2019s what they did about it. The Challenge: Reduce Product Returns While customers were eager to spend thousands for the company\u2019s high-end home brewing machines, something was going wrong between the point of purchase and the first cup. Customers struggling with set-up and installation issues were either giving up on support or bypassing it altogether. As a result, the company saw a growing number of frustrated buyers who found it easier to put the coffee machine back in the box and return it to the store. The number of product returns became a cause for concern. The manufacturer incurred the high costs (and wasted hours) of shipping the coffee machines back to evaluate each return. They had to take a hit on products deemed \u201cfaulty\u201d that were perfectly functional because returned coffee machines (no longer technically \u201cnew\u201d) could not be sold at full price. The company needed a solution to help reverse this expensive trend. The Solution: Give Agents Eyes on Site The company leveraged SightCall to give their support agents a visual advantage when it came to customer service. If a customer was having issues with coffee machine set-up or installation, an agent could send a link and connect instantly via video to the customer\u2019s smartphone or tablet. Experts working from anywhere could guide customers step-by-step using enhanced video with the ability to annotate, scan serial numbers and share high-resolution photos and videos. The Results: Seeing More Solves Faster Customers embraced the visual engagement offered by support. Agents were able to provide clear and immediate visual instructions for proper set-up, installation and operation. The machines got connected and the coffee beans got ground. Customer cups got filled with espressos, cappuccinos and lattes. And the manufacturer reduced the rate of product returns by 35%! RELATED READ: ELEVATING THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE WITH SMART INSTALLATION The Case of the Troubled TV Techs: How Supporting Third-Party Technicians Boosted CSAT and FTFR A global leader in consumer electronics and entertainment with six major business segments and over 110,000 employees worldwide faced a challenge in their TV division. Even though they are a huge company, there are considerably more of their televisions out in the world than there are service experts. That\u2019s why the company relies heavily on an extended network of third-party technicians. While this is common practice for consumer electronics companies, the big problem was communication. The Challenge: Improve Customer Satisfaction with Service Calls The third-party technicians were rarely specialists in their brand. In fact, most of them probably weren\u2019t even TV experts. One field service freelancer could spend all morning working on washing machines and dishwashers before rolling up his sleeves to troubleshoot an 85\u2033 smart TV later that afternoon. On-site techs who were less \u201cbrand-savvy\u201d had to call in for assistance. This meant company experts in the contact center had to talk technicians through steps and solutions over the phone or through a series of emails and texts. It was an inelegant solution that slowed the repair process way down and often resulted in delays and multiple service visits to resolve the issue. Customers were less than thrilled by the sluggish service and the company saw that frustration reflected in dwindling CSAT and NPS scores. It didn\u2019t help that the pandemic completely changed consumer expectations. Stuck at home for months on end, people learned to seek out companies and service providers that could make their lives easier and solve problems faster. They didn\u2019t care WHY the person sent to fix their TV couldn\u2019t fix it. They just wanted to wrap up the final season of Game of Thrones ASAP. The company needed a much better way to connect in-house experts with on-site service pros. The Solution: Showing Instead of Telling The company implemented SightCall Visual Support between their contact center and field technicians. Now, when an on-site issue requires an expert eye, agents can initiate a SightCall video session. The Visual Support platform gives customer service agents the power to see for themselves and allows them to provide clear, visual instructions to the technician. Brand experts can be just as effective as if they were there on-site. Enhanced visual tools allow the remote agent to capture data on the call including photos, video, and serial numbers. Replacement parts can be verified, ordered, and shipped at the click of a button. The Results: Less Frustration, More Satisfaction The company has reported that Visual Support pays for itself. It has significantly reduced their average handle time, improved the first-time fix rate, and helped clear up customer issues\u2026 which boosted their customer satisfaction numbers\u2026 which was the whole reason they reached out to SightCall in the first place! The company has since expanded visual support beyond the contact-center-to-field-tech pipeline, by using SightCall to connect SMEs directly to consumers. And the feedback is that agents using SightCall have already seen the value in remote video support. Instead of playing phone and email tag with customers who have submitted incomplete service requests, agents can use Visual Support to immediately verify missing information, scan serial numbers and identify replacement parts. For contact center service teams, this also reduces errors in product returns and helps close open tickets faster.

Welcome to the cloud. If you\u2019ve done research on moving your customer support operations to a virtual, cloud-based contact center, you may have heard the hype. Gone are the days of clunky on-premise systems that require extensive hardware investments and constant maintenance! Gone are the days when scaling up was slow and expensive and meant ordering new desks, computers, and coffee mugs! Gone are the days when introducing new customer service tools took months! Can the cloud really be the greatest thing to happen to contact centers since the hands-free receiver? It certainly looks that way. From startups to multinational corporations, companies of all sizes are recognizing the game-changing potential of cloud-based contact centers. And according to 2023 research from Deloitte Digital, \u201cIn the past two years alone, the number of organizations that have moved analytics, customer relationship management (CRM), knowledge management, interaction recording and workforce management systems to cloud has increased by approximately 50%.\u201d But wait, there\u2019s more\u2026 \u201cBy retiring legacy tech debt, these organizations can enable more advanced capabilities, greater scalability and superior customer experiences at a reduced cost.\u201d And the Deloitte study also states that, \u201cAltogether, three in four companies will have cloud-based interactive voice response (IVR), interaction recording and CRM systems within two years. Two in three will have cloud-based automatic call distribution (ACD).\u201d That sounds like more than just a trend to us. It sounds like full-steam ahead digital transformation. What is a Cloud Contact Center? Imagine an enormous room filled with rows of cubicles that stretch as far as the eye can see. Inside those cubicles are helpful people with headsets, who fill the entire room with the chatter and buzz of customer support conversations. Cloud-based contact centers are the exact opposite of that. A more formal definition, according to Genesys, explains that a cloud contact center is \u201cA central point in an enterprise, hosted on an Internet server, from which all inbound and outbound customer communications are handled. Cloud contact centers make interactions through voice, email, social media and the web accessible from virtually anywhere.\u201d Cloud-based contact centers are replacing traditional call center buildings and equipment. The helpful people are still there, just not all in the same place. Cloud-based call center solutions have gained significant popularity due to their flexibility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. Experts predict an appealing trifecta like that will have companies migrating en masse into the next decade. \u201cThe cloud-based contact centers market size is projected to reach USD 82.43 Billion by 2030 (growing at a CAGR of 21.3%)\u201d \u2013 Source: GlobeNewswire/Straits Research What are the Benefits of Cloud-Based Contact Centers? Scalability and Flexibility: Easier to handle fluctuations in call volumes, seasonal peaks, or business expansion more efficiently. Remote work capabilities empower agents to work from anywhere, enhancing flexibility in scheduling, and enabling 24/7 customer support. Cost Efficiency: Cloud-based contact centers eliminate the need for significant upfront capital investments in hardware, software licenses, and maintenance. Instead, companies can pay for services on a subscription or usage-based model, allowing for predictable and manageable operational expenses. Top providers also handle infrastructure maintenance, upgrades, and security, so your organization can save on IT resources and associated costs. Enhanced Customer Experience: Cloud-based contact centers provide a range of features and tools that can significantly enhance the customer experience. \u2013 Intelligent routing \u2013 Interactive voice response (IVR) systems \u2013 Omnichannel support (phone, email, chat, social media) \u2013 Integration with customer relationship management (CRM) systems These capabilities enable personalized and efficient customer interactions, reduced wait times, and quicker issue resolution. Additionally, cloud solutions often incorporate advanced analytics and AI-driven features, such as sentiment analysis and speech recognition, enabling better understanding of customer needs and improved service quality. Security: Cloud contact centers can reduce the risk of data breaches and other security incidents, offering a safer environment for sensitive customer data. Cloud providers invest heavily in building and maintaining secure infrastructure. They adhere to industry-leading security standards and compliance frameworks, such as ISO 27001, SOC 2, and GDPR. They implement stringent data protection measures, including encryption at rest and in transit, regular data backups, and robust access controls. What\u2019s the Bottom Line? When it comes to contact centers, it\u2019s becoming clear that the old ways of doing business are no longer sustainable. Change is in the clouds. \u201c68% of contact center and CX leaders say their current technology solutions are somewhat or not at all effective in supporting digital transformation.\u201d \u2013 Source: 8\u00d78 Instead of struggling to keep up with evolving technology and the rising costs (and risks) of managing a traditional, in-person workforce, companies are recognizing the benefits of going virtual. A unified support platform gives them immediate access to an almost unlimited set of technologies and tools for solving problems faster and serving better. Migrating to the cloud takes a lot of daily distractions off the table and allows them to focus squarely on the experience of their customers. And they recognize the transformative potential that this technology holds for their business growth, customer satisfaction, and operational efficiency.

He\u2019s been working in his yard all morning. It\u2019s hot and those weeds won\u2019t pull themselves. All Marcus wants is a tall glass of ice water from his new refrigerator. The machine is not cooperating. That\u2019s why he called for help. \u201cThe light goes on,\u201d he says. \u201cI hear a noise, but nothing comes out.\u201d Marcus doesn\u2019t want a link to a PDF manual. He doesn\u2019t want to spend 30 minutes troubleshooting. Marcus wants a cold drink. You can hear his frustration, but without video, you can\u2019t SEE what Marcus sees. If you connected on video, he could show you what\u2019s wrong and you could show him exactly how to make it right. But without video, solving his problem takes longer. Contact centers who limit their agents to voice and text, are asking them to solve customer problems with their eyes covered. Take off the blindfolds and let them see what the customers see. When you add video to your contact center toolbox, you give every team member a customer\u2019s-eye-view. Problems get solved faster and customers like Marcus end up happier. Reason #2 \u2013 Video Fosters Empathy Carol said her neighborhood was on the news. \u201cLast night\u2019s storm made a mess,\u201d she said. \u201cNext door lost both cars to a massive oak.\u201d Because she called on video, it\u2019s easy to see that Carol is upset. Her eyes teared up as she spoke. Nothing happened to Carol\u2019s house, but she\u2019s worried. She\u2019s worried about more storms forecast for next week and the \u201cbig old trees.\u201d And she\u2019s particularly worried about the rustic barn out back. In November, Carol\u2019s oldest daughter is getting married in that barn and she needs it in one piece. She called her insurance company to make sure the barn was covered because she couldn\u2019t remember. She apologized for sounding silly. Because Carol called on video, the agent could tell her that yes, the barn was covered and there was no need to apologize. She could say a few things to make Carol feel better. \u201cWeddings are a big deal.\u201d \u201cFeel free to call back anytime if you have a question. We\u2019re here to help.\u201d The agent could see Carol\u2019s relief\u2026 followed by a sigh and smile. Using video, representatives can introduce themselves as individuals, show genuine empathy, and establish a stronger connection with customers, ultimately enhancing the customer experience. Reason #3 \u2013 Video Can Quickly Solve Complex Problems It\u2019s a familiar scene in action movies: Our brave hero has only 30 seconds to diffuse a bomb that could destroy the whole city. A desperate call is placed to the bomb expert, who tells our hero to \u201ccut the blue wire.\u201d Unfortunately, ALL of the wires are blue. If we had half an hour, the expert could talk our hero through the process of finding the RIGHT blue wire. If we had 20 minutes, the bomb expert could retrieve and send detailed PDF instructions for dismantling this particular model of bomb. But the clock is ticking and time is NOT on our side. Fortunately, the expert called using video, so our hero pointed his phone camera and was told to \u201cCut the lighter blue wire on the far left.\u201d Snip. Sigh. Two seconds to spare. Video saves the day! Video can help make short work of complex problems. Some customer issues may require visual demonstrations or explanations. Using video, agents can share step-by-step instructions or visually troubleshoot complex problems, leading to faster and more effective issue resolution. There\u2019s a big difference between saving a city and closing a customer complaint, but it still feels good to be a hero. Reason #4 \u2013 Video Delivers a More Human Experience Robert is a normal guy. He\u2019s just a little old-fashioned. He doesn\u2019t believe that AI is out to take over the world. He just doesn\u2019t like chatbots. Or email. Or texts. He\u2019d rather talk to a human being. If you give Robert the option to connect to video support? He\u2019ll choose it every single time. Is it because video adds a personal touch to customer service interactions? Is it because on a human-to-human level, non-verbal cues like facial expressions and body language can be better interpreted, improving the overall experience for both customer and agent? Or is it because a visual support session can be the most consistent way of achieving first contact resolution (FCR)? \u201cAll of the above, I guess,\u201d Robert might say. \u201cBut I just like to see who I\u2019m talking to.\u201d It\u2019s not just Robert who prefers human interaction. According to PwC, 59% of all consumers feel companies have lost touch with the human element of customer experience. And 82% of U.S. and 74% of non-U.S. consumers want more of it in the future. Looking for a more constructive way to connect with customers? Video instantly delivers a more human experience. Reason #5 \u2013 The Future of Customer Service is Visual When it comes to the art and science of solving customer problems, contact centers have always been quick to embrace new technology. The telephone reigned as the undisputed Heavyweight Champ of Customer Service since its inbound debut in the late 1950s. Billions of issues have been solved with a phone call and enterprise contact centers relied on voice alone for decades. Innovations like automatic call distribution (ACD) and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) supercharged the ability to handle larger call volumes. And the rise of computers turned contact centers into fine-tuned customer service machines. Email, texts and chatbots added even more speed, convenience and clarity. Today, the most successful service organizations are going beyond just listening, talking and typing. They understand that the future of service is visual. Instead of \u201ctell me what\u2019s wrong,\u201d agents can say, \u201cShow me the problem and I\u2019ll show you how to fix it.\u201d Most importantly, video is what customers are asking for. One source reports that consumer preferences for the use of video in customer service has increased by 70%. Another notes that 94% of consumers rate video support to be a positive experience. And research from Genesys shows the use of video by customers has DOUBLED between 2019 and 2021. Contact centers that can successfully leverage video and visual support are creating simpler, more personal and more productive customer experiences.

That\u2019s why the most successful companies focus on faster response and more efficient service. SightCall Digital Flows help your customers get straight to solving the problem. When something goes wrong with critical medical equipment, your customer can immediately launch a self-serve triage sequence. A custom digital workflow will guide your customer step-by-step to a solution: It will help them identify their equipment. It will provide a list of common issues they can use to try to solve the error on their own. And if the issue proves too complex, SightCall\u2019s global video network is always there to connect them to a service agent who can see details collected on-site in real-time. You get support sessions that are focused on problem solving, not collecting contact information and serial numbers. SightCall\u2019s solution enables your experienced technicians to minimize their truck rolls, adding efficiency and scale to your service operations. And with a connected process, all information shared prior to and during the video session is uploaded to any system you have in place, creating transparency for both you and your customers.

But sending a technician on-site for every inspection can get expensive. And if any part of their inspection process still includes handwriting, paper forms, and manual entry? It will cost even more in careless errors and wasted time. That\u2019s why digitizing your inspection process is the most consistent and accurate way to meet both your customer\u2019s expectations and any safety regulations. Using SightCall, any inspection can be initiated right from the service order so the correct inspection process is initiated every time. You can enforce and track safety compliance easily within the digital process workflow. Using advanced scanning features like OCR and QR code scanning, you can accurately extract machine IDs, giving you easy access to service history using SightCall\u2019s native integration connectors. When the inspection is complete, all information collected, including photos and videos, are uploaded to your system of record giving your service teams instant access to the real-time data. SightCall gives you the peace of mind that each inspection is consistent and accountable. If you\u2019ve ever wondered how you could afford to digitize your inspection process.

It\u2019s a time of tremendous challenges and equally massive opportunities for companies who are ready to innovate and embrace new technologies. I recently appeared as a guest on the inService Podcast Series, hosted by Service Council CEO, John Carroll. The topic was \u201cBridging the Physical & Digital World.\u201d Our conversation included advice about how organizations can address gaps in their digitization efforts, the evolution of customer relationships and the findings from Service Council\u2019s recent parts management survey. Here are six highlights and my key takeaways from the episode: Customers want more, but companies are having to do more with less. Efficiency is the real challenge. Last year, I traveled the world to meet with our top customers. I can tell you that \u201chaving to do more with less\u201d is a common trend everywhere. Companies are trying to deliver the best customer service experience while having this constant pressure on cost, on resources, and dealing with the talent shortage in field service organizations. Not only are they facing these economic pressures, but they are also facing higher expectations from customers wanting more immediate solutions. When you order something on Amazon, you take out your smartphone. After three clicks, it\u2019s in your cart and you know it will be delivered tomorrow. That\u2019s the kind of service that they expect. When you want a driver, you click on Uber and you\u2019ve got a car. And you can track the car as it comes closer. That\u2019s what field service customers expect now. When a machine is not working as expected, they want the same seamless service experience as they would have in their personal life using Amazon or Uber. The best systems connector is a human being. Remember 20 years ago, when we thought that IoT would be everywhere? That every piece of equipment would be connected and would communicate to the internet? Unfortunately, we\u2019re still in a world where most of the equipment that our field service teams have to manage, maintain, and install, is not connected to the internet (or only part of them is connected). The challenge we\u2019ve had to overcome is wanting to be more proactive in servicing this equipment, but also accepting that much of this equipment is not in the digital world yet. That\u2019s why we need to create a bridge between this equipment and all the software tools and applications we have on computers and smartphones. Your CRM, your field service management software, your ERP, your asset management\u2026 Each of them has their own specificity that helps your customer and customer contract. Unfortunately, odds are good that your asset management is not directly connected to your CRM. Most systems are still siloed. But we found that a good way to connect these systems was with a human. Use the person on site who has the equipment in front of them and their smartphone with all these digital tools. Leverage the unique capabilities of smartphones that we all have in our pocket: the back camera, the screen, the computing power, and the connectivity. The camera is used to see and identify the parts and equipment in front of the technician and a remote expert (or AI engine) on the other end can guide them. We help update and connect to your digital software, so all tasks related to the work order can be completed within the same context. Integration has become easier than ever before. I remember the last Service Council symposium in Chicago. The technology group came into the room where the field service leaders were, and asked, \u201cHow can the technology group can help you better in your transformation journey?\u201d And the first thing that came up was integration. When you service equipment, your job is not to work on connecting software. That\u2019s part of our responsibility as software provider. Twenty years ago, you would have utilized a big IT team and system integrators. It would be a massive project that took a lot of time to connect everything and build a system to fit your business needs. Today, we\u2019ve moved this responsibility to the cloud service providers. And there are standard protocols that we can all use to create APIs. APIs connect systems together. How we connect is well defined right now. The smart platforms are also leveraging this type of \u201cAPI first\u201d momentum. Each time we meet with a provider that we need to connect with, the standards are straightforward. It takes a matter of hours to get the platforms connected. We can interconnect with everything that has an API, and it\u2019s not that complex. It goes fast and should not cost much. The goal of digitization, digitalization, and digital transformation is to create value. Digitization is something that happened in the past 20 years where you had all these paper manuals that you wanted to convert into digital manuals. There was a lot of scanning large books to get them into PDF format and make them available to employees or customers when they needed to access them through their smartphone or computer, instead of having to ship a book, right? That was the big piece of the digitization era. I still see a lot of pens and paper in the field. So, we\u2019re not a hundred percent done with digitization, but I think we are already well advanced in this process. The one that happened next is digitalization. Digitalization is about developing processes and changing workflows to improve manual tasks. You take this manual action that you had to do in the past and see how it can be streamlined either directly by machine or guided through a digital tool for the person to follow this process. The third layer is digital transformation. Digital transformation is a terminology that is maybe has been used too much, right? We know that it\u2019s all over the place. Digital transformation is kind of the Holy Grail, right? Everybody wants to go through digital transformation. So, what is it? Digital transformation is all about leveraging this knowledge and integrating it into business areas to enhance engagement and create value. You take what you have, what you do today, and bring it to another level through digital platforms to create new value, new value offerings. For example, building 24/7 service with visual assistance. Instead of having to dispatch a technician on-site, you can have experts provide a guided experience on a 24/7 basis that you could not do with your technicians. We have had clients deploy 24/7 support with a kind of a follow-the-sun model, using different locations around the world. That way, even if someone has a problem at 4:00 AM, it\u2019s always daylight somewhere in the world. Their customers can always connect with someone who can help and guide them. Transparency always improves the customer experience. By connecting the physical and digital worlds, you can get better communication and information. I met with one of our customers last month and they shared that not having their asset management connected to their CRM was one of their big pain points. A customer would call to let them know a part needs to be replaced. But they would tell the customer that the new part should arrive \u201cwithin one or two weeks.\u201d That answer worked before COVID, when parts delivery was kind of fluid. During COVID, they had challenges with parts delivery and suddenly this answer was not valuable anymore. And the customer would call back a week or two later, saying, \u201cyou told me I should receive my part within two weeks. I don\u2019t have it.\u201d The company can only say, \u201cI\u2019m sorry maybe it should come this week.\u201d But they have no visibility there. And you can imagine how unhappy this customer was after 12 weeks of calling customer support every week to check the status of the part. If the customer service agent had access to trackability, they could\u2019ve set the right expectation upfront. Transparency is the new customer expectation. Companies can\u2019t afford to be blind anymore. Connecting the systems and communicating to the customer is how you improve the experience that you deliver. There\u2019s one statistic that I loved in the Service Council survey about parts management/parts delivery. 24% of unsuccessful service visits are due to not having the right part on site. This is a perfect example of things that we can fix, right? Why would the technician go on site without having the right part? There could be 50 different reasons and circumstances, but it should not happen. If we can track and identify this part and connect the systems, we can make sure that the part will be there when this technician goes on site. And we can make certain that this part will be the right part. These are the kinds of problems that can be solved by connecting physical assets to your digital systems. Cutting costs can impact more than just the bottom line. Everybody wants to measure the value of a new system, which makes complete sense. And we love to implement metrics dashboards and reporting to measure this value. I can tell you that with most of our customers, the ROI is demonstrated in less than two months. In terms of truck rolls, the cost can go from $250 to over $2,500 per dispatch depending on the distance, the duration, and the type of transportation. In terms of showing value, it\u2019s a simple calculation that we can do each time we save a truck roll. What\u2019s the average number that we see across the board? I can tell you the large field service organizations that implement SightCall, literally cut more than 50% of their truck rolls. This number is massive. That was not even my goal when I started the company. I discovered it later. Why do we have such a massive impact? Well, what I saw across these deployments is that most onsite visits are not a visit where you effectively perform an action, a physical repair on the machine. There are a lot of pre-visit troubleshooting and post-visit inspections, and of course, the visits that are not successful the first time. Now, instead of sending someone to do a pre-visit or assessment, you can remotely engage the customer directly or connect to the person in front of the equipment. These pre-assessment calls can save an onsite visit most of the time and allow you to collect all the information you need. You can leverage your customer\u2019s smartphone, even if they are not within your organization, to help collect the information that you need. Optical character recognition or AI image recognition capabilities are available through their phone. This helps you identify exactly which part is there, which equipment, and what the problem is. You can collect all this data, so that when the technician does go on site, they know exactly what\u2019s going on. The other impact I love is how we support sustainability and reduce the carbon footprint. We generate a CO2 report for our customers every time they save an onsite visit. We can map it to a global database and calculate the distance traveled based on the type of vehicle that they have and the type of road. We know the gas consumption and use all this data to figure out the carbon savings. So, preventing an onsite visit also has a very strong impact on our planet.

Yes indeed, nobody knows their way around the inside of an MRI machine like Frank. And that\u2019s the problem. Because Frank is counting the days until he trades his coveralls for hip waders. His retirement day is outlined in red marker on his wall calendar. Frank is a short timer now. He plans to treat himself with a few weeks of fly-fishing in Montana before taking a 2-month Caribbean cruise with his wife, followed by \u201ca whole lot of nothing.\u201d Good for Frank. Not so great for you. Because unless you do something quick, all that knowledge in Frank\u2019s head is bound for the Bighorn River and the Bahamas. Which is nowhere near where you need it to be. Here Comes the Silver Tsunami According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment of medical equipment repairers is projected to grow much faster than the average for all other occupations. That\u2019s a big deal. The prediction is for 17% growth in a decade, which translates to roughly 7,700 job openings every year through 2031. That\u2019s more than triple the growth rate of other occupations. But before you pop the champagne and start handing out high-fives, don\u2019t forget some of the reasons for those numbers. Yes, the medical device industry is booming. The overall medical technology market value is projected to reach $579.4 billion in 2023, with medical devices taking credit for 81% ($470.6) of that total. But many of those job openings will come from the serious talent crisis in the field service profession. As more experienced engineers switch jobs or retire, companies are scrambling to plug their workforce gaps. This skilled workforce crisis has been looming for decades and the pandemic only made it worse. In 2021, 47 million people quit their jobs in what was called The Great Resignation. And according to an article by the National Association of Manufacturers, 1.4 million U.S. manufacturing jobs were lost during the early days of the pandemic. That \u201cset the manufacturing labor force back by more than a decade.\u201d And the manufacturing skills gap in the U.S. could result in 2.1 million unfilled jobs by 2030, according to another study by Deloitte and The Manufacturing Institute. Those losses come on top of what the labor market has been bracing for, which is the \u201caging out\u201d of the boomer generation. Some call it the \u201cSilver Tsunami,\u201d which drives home the idea that the potential impact on service organizations could be absolutely devastating. What are you supposed to do in the face of so much change and big numbers? One of the biggest fears among manufacturers and service organizations is that future waves of retirees will leave whole industries without critical institutional knowledge. That\u2019s why it\u2019s urgent to take steps now to retain, organize and pass that knowledge down to the next generation of field engineers. If your company hasn\u2019t done it yet, you need to find ways to pass down all the industry experience and information from your senior workforce before they leave. How to use enhanced video technology to accelerate upskilling Machines in the med tech space are complicated and the learning curve is steep. Advanced equipment is costly, compliance is strict, and the consequences of a malfunction can literally be life or death. That\u2019s why field engineers who work on medical devices are always challenged to keep up. As long as science and technology continue to evolve, training will always be a part of the med device technician\u2019s job. This is not a problem for employers because investing in skill-based training works. In a survey by the US Chamber of Commerce and SHRM, the top two reasons given by employers were that skill-based training provides a return on investment (63%) and helps directly address skills gaps (62%). The bigger issue for companies right now is time. Today, and every day until 2030, 10,000 Boomers will reach retirement age. Upskilling and training doesn\u2019t happen overnight. But there are more efficient ways for it to happen on the job. Here\u2019s where it might pay dividends to expand your definition of training. Clear your mind for a moment of any traditional notions of training. Forget about online courses, in-person seminars or apprenticeship programs. What if more training could come from simply watching really skilled people do their job? From anywhere at any time? And not passively watching videos on YouTube, either. We\u2019re talking about an active and engaged visual session between veteran engineers and rookie field techs. We know that using remote expert guidance is proving to be one of the most effective tools for helping train junior field engineers on medical equipment. How do we know? Because companies all over the world are using it right now. What are the benefits of using remote expert guidance for medical device training? It\u2019s a long list, but we\u2019ll keep it brief. First, trainees get the benefit of watching the work in a real world context, with locations and customers they may likely encounter in the future. Seeing and hearing a senior engineer as they perform tasks can provide a more engaging learning experience for junior technicians. They can watch the senior engineer\u2019s technique, ask questions in real-time, and receive immediate feedback. The use of remote video eliminates the need for junior technicians to physically be on-site with a senior engineer. This can save time and money, as it reduces travel costs and the time it takes to schedule on-site training. Junior techs can also review the recorded sessions at their own pace. This flexibility can lead to increased efficiency in training, as they can access the video sessions whenever they need a refresher or have a question. This can improve retention because the more they see and hear, the better they will remember. Finally, remote video training can also provide a standardized method of training, which ensures that all junior technicians receive the same information and instruction, regardless of their location. This can help to reduce training inconsistencies and ensure that junior technicians have a consistent and comprehensive understanding of the skills and knowledge they need to perform their field work. In turn, this can help to increase the overall quality of work performed by junior techs, and ensure that they are better equipped to handle complex service calls. Invest in technology that helps you leverage your best talent Every industry on Earth has felt the massive shift in the way people work. More companies are seeking a balance between people and technology, remote and on-site, and tradition and innovation. That\u2019s why one of the biggest buzzwords of the last few years has been \u201chybrid,\u201d which describes that happy medium place in the middle of it all. Hands-on, face-to-face training will never completely go away. So long as these machines exist in physical reality, it will take people with actual tools and genuine skills to fix them. But as more companies struggle to cope with outside forces such as the economy, the workforce, changing technology and growing competition, they are finding advantages in learning to work smarter with technology. Efficiency doesn\u2019t happen by accident. So before your most experienced engineer trades his company cap for one of those fishing caps covered in feathery lures, maybe think about investing in digital tools to get all that good stuff out of his head.

That\u2019s an unfortunate truth for insurance companies. You have no way of warning Debbie about the guy on his phone who is going to run the red light. You can\u2019t tell her to speed up or slow down. You can\u2019t stop time. His car is going to hit hers. It\u2019s going to be loud and scary. And even though nobody will be seriously hurt, Debbie is going to have a really bad day. The best you can do is not make it worse. Once Debbie calms down and reaches for her phone, everything that happens next is up to you. This is your moment to shine. What kind of experience will Debbie have? Hint: It should be effortless and quick with clear communication and empathy. Debbie doesn\u2019t want to listen to hold music, download forms or go over contact information you should already know. She wants speed, clarity and convenience. And if you can\u2019t deliver\u2026 there\u2019s always someone else who can. It wasn\u2019t always like this for insurance companies, but times have changed. Have you changed along with them? Disruption Demands Innovation It\u2019s been a rough few years for the insurance industry. One global pandemic. Multiple record-breaking storms and natural disasters. A world economy that feels like an amusement park thrill ride. Premium growth slowed. Inflation grew. In a 2022 report, McKinsey noted that profit in the insurance industry \u201cis practically at a standstill.\u201d Thanks to companies like Amazon, customers have higher expectations when it comes to standards of service. They want speed and simplicity. They aren\u2019t afraid to exercise their power of choice. To make matters worse for carriers, a wave of upstarts and entrepreneurs have come along in recent years with hopes of reinventing the insurance industry with new technology and bold business models based on big data. Insurtech has disrupted the status quo the same way that Fintech shook up the banking world. And while investment in Insurtech has dipped slightly after peaking in 2021 (at $14.4 billion), the threat to stubbornly traditional companies remains real. McKinsey\u2019s report noted that Insurtechs can solve \u201ccustomer pain points through a digitally enhanced client experience that could pose a competitive threat to incumbents.\u201d These challenges and competitors have made one thing clear to legacy insurers: it\u2019s time to evolve. Digital transformation is the only option for survival. Because while P&C companies around the world are experts at assessing risk for others with formulas and complex math, they don\u2019t need a calculator to understand that the cost of doing nothing is way too high. \u201cOnly a transformative approach will allow an insurer to survive and thrive in a post-COVID-19 world.\u201d \u2013 McKinsey Global Insurance Report 2022 The Future of Insurance Technology Insurance is complicated. Major carriers have deep wells of expertise and experience. Industry knowledge acquired over decades, and sometimes centuries, of doing business. It\u2019s unrealistic to think that one product, application or piece of software can transform your company overnight. But when it comes to useful tools that can elevate the customer experience, streamline inefficient processes, and put your company on the path to operational excellence? Nothing helps grow your bottom line better (or faster) than the right technology. Here are five of the biggest tech topics that we think will keep coming up in insurance industry conversations in the year ahead\u2026 1. Visual Claims People hate wasting time. For decades, the only way that agents and customers connected to deal with a claim was in person. Even companies who prided themselves on excellent service made their customers wait for it. Agents could spend hours in transit, hours on site and hours trying to hustle home before supper. Even if the claim was filed and business was sealed with a handshake and smile, it was still sandwiched between a whole bunch of waiting around doing nothing. Wasted minutes. Wasted miles. Today, companies can connect immediately from anywhere to anywhere. They\u2019ve been doing it for a while and the tools keep getting better and better. Advanced visual capabilities are giving agents the ability to go beyond live video to collect data using advanced tools like geolocation, OCR, augmented reality (AR) and artificial intelligence (AI). While not every claim can be resolved remotely, the right visual claims tool can dramatically reduce unnecessary travel (reducing carbon emissions) and speed the resolution of a claim (the cutting of a check). Even better? The features and functionality of these technologies are continuously evolving to meet the needs of your customers and service teams. 2. Digital Process Automation Nobody gets excited about paperwork. Plodding your way through a pile of physical forms is the epitome of drudgery. Unfortunately, assessing risk is a complicated business that comes with lots of documents and tons of tiny print that needs to be entered, reviewed, initialed, and signed. The more of those manual processes that insurers can transition beyond pen and paper, the better. Companies can\u2019t realistically expect to evolve if they\u2019re still bogging their people down with busywork. Filling out forms by hand is slow, wasteful, and prone to human error. And mistakes cost money. Consider these stats from KPMG: 25% of every premium dollar is consumed by operating expenses Automation can reduce repetitive agent work by 80% Automation can also cut claims processing time by 50% What is digital process automation? Simply put, it\u2019s trading manual processes and forms for a digital alternative that can be completed online or on a smartphone or tablet. Implementing digital automation can lower operational costs and speed outcomes. This kind of automation is not about handing jobs to robots, it\u2019s about empowering your employees and customers with better ways to do business. It\u2019s about designing repeatable electronic instructions that reduce friction and create seamless experiences. It\u2019s about working smarter, faster, and more efficiently. 3. Omnichannel Customers want control. Providing different ways to connect is giving them that control. Most insurers understand the basic concept of \u201comnichannel\u201d and communicate with customers via telephone, snail mail, email, text and chatbots or forms that live on their website. But the big shift comes when companies can make those customer channels smarter and easier to use. The key is to provide an engaging experience anywhere and everywhere. At any time. It\u2019s great to have a chatbot that can answer basic questions or connect people to a customer service agent. But it\u2019s even better to have a chatbot that learns and gets smarter with every conversation. One of the biggest benefits of expanding and enhancing your omni channel offerings? Customers are more likely to self-serve. Shifting more and more of the less complex questions and tasks to self-service mode will save countless hours and resources over time. But don\u2019t forget: customers don\u2019t want to get stuck alone in \u201cthe matrix.\u201d In a conversation with the Insurance Innovation Reporter, Peter Blanc, group chief executive at Aston Lark said, \u201cClients hate digital journeys with no ability to exit or talk to a human\u2026 we shouldn\u2019t use digital to \u2018force\u2019 clients into an efficient journey that could leave them unsatisfied and unable to get a solution.\u201d Always give them a way to connect with a person. \u201cThe equation is pretty simple: the easier you make it to buy and sell insurance, the more insurance you\u2019ll sell. The harder you make it, the less you\u2019ll sell.\u201d \u2013 Chuck Wilson via Coverager 4. Data Integration Remember the forms that digital process automation helps reduce? Those stacks of paper might be gone, but all of the information inside those boxes and blanks need to go somewhere. Sometimes in the rush to roll out new technology and tools it\u2019s easy to overlook compatibility. Think of each app or software platform as an athlete on your team. Even if you have a team of superstars on the field, things fall apart if they\u2019re all speaking a different language. That\u2019s why one of the most important building blocks of operational efficiency is data integration. The first step in building a more efficient ecosystem is to break up silos. Your systems and platforms need to talk and work together. Sometimes that requires digital transformation on a larger scale. One expert at Forrester estimated that \u201cover 90% of companies are using technology to modernize their existing business model vs. transforming it.\u201d The bad news? Transforming will take longer and cost more. The good news? Transforming your full tech stack will help create a more robust customer journey and generate new worlds of revenue opportunity. A great way to get started? Invest in digital tools that play well with others. 5. Artificial Intelligence + Augmented Reality They call them buzzwords for a reason. You hear everybody talking about \u201caugmented reality\u201d and \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d because they work. According to Microsoft, by 2025, artificial intelligence (AI) is predicted to drive 95% of customer experience. And Deloitte stated that 88% of medium-sized businesses are already using or testing AR for some purposes. How can you use AI and AR in insurance? Companies have already implemented these tools to enhance the customer experience and help agents do everything from assess damage and detect fraud to streamline claims processing and optimize routine office tasks. Augmented reality is already available and in use by agents who connect with customers through advanced visual claims tools. And here\u2019s the thing about artificial intelligence: it gets smarter every day. The quicker you put it to work inside your company, the faster it can capture data and insights that you can use to differentiate yourself in the market. \u201c\u2026the mission should not be: how do we take what we do today and deliver in a digital way? Instead, we should focus on how we seamlessly blend the capabilities that digital provides into the perfect customer service.\u201d \u2013 Phillip Williams, Clear Group via Insurance Age UK Are you ready for the future of insurance? Nobody knows for sure what happens next, but everybody is getting buckled up for a bumpy ride. Insurers know better than anyone that you should always expect the unexpected. Hope for the best, but plan for the worst. You know the drill. In terms of digital transformation, maybe it\u2019s best to think of each piece of technology as a tool. A tool to give your customer a better experience and help your agents and brokers focus on what matters. A tool to drive efficiency and improve flexibility. A tool that prepares you for the future. Yes, it can all be a bit overwhelming. But remember that innovation doesn\u2019t have to be an all or nothing deal. There isn\u2019t a company on the planet that can reinvent everything all at once. It doesn\u2019t happen with a snap of the fingers. If you\u2019re feeling behind the technology curve, the most important step you can take is the first one. Do something. Test one tool. Make one process more efficient. If you\u2019re moving forward, you\u2019re headed in the right direction.

Research from Deloitte points to an expansion rate of more than 4% in 2022, with industry players turning would-be weaknesses into competitive advantages by innovating solutions for supply chain challenges and digital technology adoption. The increasing use of augmented reality (AR) tools by manufacturers is no exception to this. If the factories of the future, as Harvard Business Review wrote in 2018, will run on better processes \u2013 and not simply more sophisticated tools \u2013 AR is one of the strongest candidates out there. Its adoption can implement real, radical change that boosts worker experiences, drives innovation, and achieves essential improvements in productivity and costs. Surveying the manufacturing industry landscape Priorities for manufacturing, both in 2022 and beyond, will involve meeting several challenges with dynamic and responsive solutions: The need for supply chain adaptability, with multi-tiered responses to external disruptions. A combination of demographic shifts, changing customer expectations, and a skills gap where the expertise needed and the expertise that exists in the workforce are mismatched. The latter means, in particular, that training, upskilling, and reskilling will need to change. Increased public attention to companies\u2019 climate impact, with a need for them to show, not tell how they are responding to environmental concerns and decreasing their footprint. The complexities of digital technology adoption, with digitization needing to be integrated within as few tools as possible, rather than organized in silos. For our part, SightCall technology plays a role in several ways. Our AR-powered visual assistance tools minimize slow response and recovery time to disruptions, eliminate the time/cost and carbon impact of wasted dispatches, reduce employee turnover, and prevent proprietary knowledge from being lost. To gain a fuller picture as to why, read on to understand the role that augmented reality technology can play for manufacturing companies. What is Augmented Reality in Manufacturing The complexity of modern technology, diagnostic systems, and computerized interfaces means that technicians now require a higher level of training and certification than their predecessors. Consequently, AR blends the physical and digital world by superimposing images and text onto a user\u2019s view through a device, such as a smartphone or a tablet, and provides an enhanced composite view. Augmented reality empowers manufacturing workforces and elevates service offerings through better resolution rates, reduced downtime, and improved customer satisfaction. Using tools with augmented reality features can augment a technician\u2019s skills and knowledge by providing them with all the resources they need to complete tasks including instructions, manuals, and even live support from more senior technicians. What is AR-powered visual support? Visual assistance, otherwise known as visual support, connects technicians and experts in a virtual, interactive environment where they can troubleshoot, train and resolve complex work orders with reliable video, augmented reality, and artificial intelligence (AI) insights. AR tools in visual support allow technicians to make on-screen annotations, obtain accurate measurements remotely, and share images and information during the live video session. With AR, an organization\u2019s most skilled technicians can handle more jobs remotely, giving them the freedom to focus on high-value customers, complex repairs, and supporting technicians in the field. What are the benefits of Augmented Reality for Manufacturing? How many failed work orders would be successful if there was an easier way to receive guidance in the field? With visual support, technicians have immediate access to remote experts, ensuring that they are never alone on a service call. From any mobile device or wearable, they can receive live, AR-powered visual assistance to help them resolve complex tasks. Customer support: Manufacturing organizations can differentiate themselves with a modern approach to remote customer support. With immediate visual assistance, they can reduce the service wait from days to minutes. Technician support: Manufacturing organizations can equip their service teams with one-touch visual assistance through a mobile app or wearable, improving uptime and empowering their technicians to accomplish tasks on the first call. Hands-on training: Manufacturing organizations can empower their technicians with the ability to learn new skills on the job. Less experienced technicians and engineers can use visual assistance, AR, and AI to guide them through new repairs and complicated work orders. Data- driven maintenance: Using AI-driven insights, manufacturing organizations can make informed decisions by identifying parts, diagnosing issues, and proposing solutions based on data. Tools such as Smart Optical Character Recognition also help to accurately read and interpret data on a machine. They can identify printer parts with 100% accuracy by simply taking a photo. All information is fed directly back to the case file, speeding up repairs and reducing parts wastage with no manual data entry required. Self-guided maintenance: By replacing old paper processes with AR digital processes, field agents can self-guide through a pre-structured set of workflows. SightCall empowers technicians in the field, giving them step-by-step instructions to independently complete a work order. Wearables: These digital devices can be worn on the body, embedded or contained within clothing, and even tattooed onto the skin. The leading benefit for companies adopting wearable devices for their workers is straightforward, in that handheld devices are replaced by tools like smart glasses, freeing service experts to use their hands in complex or risky work situations. According to our internal research, manufacturing companies specifically realize average improvements of: 81% in first-time fix rates A 69% reduction in time to issue resolution 50% reduction in truck rolls Knowledge savings through a 41% decrease in training time Customer satisfaction, increasing by as much as 30 points Looking for a visual augmented reality solution for your company? How can digital process automation improve manufacturing processes? Digital process automation (DPA) harnesses technology to standardize workflows, improve performance and mitigate errors that traditionally hold essential processes back. Its use entails both self-guided maintenance and human-guided visual assistance. Rather than replacing any part of the existing service experience, DPA boosts technicians\u2019 work and person-to-person connections with customers. SightCall\u2019s own Digital Flows solution digitizes manual processes to improve efficiency and reduce error. With the help of standardized, step-by-step guidance, including detailed instructions and checklists, technicians and service workers can complete tasks with no ambiguity or confusion. The training process also becomes more straightforward, with digital process automation providing new technicians or workers needing to upskill with an immersive and straightforward learning experience, mirroring the field service situations they will encounter on a daily basis. Augmented Reality in Manufacturing Use Cases Case Study 1: Remote support transforms printer maintenance MacDermid Graphics Solutions, a leading global supplier of photopolymer printing solutions based in Atlanta, Georgia, delivers high-quality graphics to customers via a diverse array of packaging products. Its operations span North and South America, as well as several countries in Europe and the Asia-Pacific. MacDermid is widely known throughout the industry for its excellent customer service. The company provides day-to-day solutions on a variety of maintenance, repair, and process issues around the world. In recent years, the company has been focused on applying virtual solutions to further improve several key performance indicators (KPIs) on equipment maintenance to bolster customer satisfaction and shorten resolution times. As with many companies, its interest in these tools increased at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. With service technicians\u2019 ability to fulfill maintenance and repair work orders on-site significantly curtailed, MacDermid had to balance keeping people safe while maintaining a hard-won reputation for customer care. As such, it was essential to find a solution that would work on mobile devices but also enabled people to use wearable gadgets like smart glasses. A primary objective was to permit technicians to be remotely guided through a task or repair process with the benefit of AR overlay, while still having both hands able to maneuver. Customers and technicians can launch SightCall remote support sessions through their own smartphones, providing and receiving crucial work order information in real-time, thanks to an integration with Salesforce. Even in low-bandwidth environments, sessions benefit from guaranteed HD picture quality and reliable video. And tools like optical character recognition (OCR) can accurately read and interpret data on a machine, even from several feet away, and feed it directly back to the work order, with no manual entry required. When technicians have no other choice but to go on-site, they can have their hands free to do the work using smart glasses, while a remote expert walks them through it. Because of this, only a single tech needs to be dispatched to handle more complicated cases. The training of junior or less experienced workers has also been boosted by the immersive experience of the platform. After only a few months of deploying remote support, MacDermid Graphics Solutions realized a 20% truck roll reduction in the number of work orders that required sending a technician on-site. Customers were also guided through issues with their printers with the help of a remote expert, increasing first-time fix rates. Case study 2: Food safety revolutionized with remote virtual audits Safe food practices impact consumers all over the world and are crucial for human health. As such, verification involves a complex, multi-level system of inspections and audits, ones which Kraft Heinz uses to ensure quality assurance, identify and coordinate improvements, and resolve issues related to customer complaints. Despite the COVID-19 crisis and the travel restrictions that came with it, Kraft Heinz needed to continue the high standards of food safety for consumers, without disrupting a supply chain built on a wide network of suppliers, copackers, and warehouses. The company required a remote virtual support system robust enough to be implemented in a variety of specific use cases, and allow for the standardization of both routine and incident-related audits. Deploying visual assistance in just weeks, Kraft Heinz leveraged SightCall for every step of their visits to their partners, including suppliers, copackers, factories, and warehouses. Before inspections begin, sessions are used to share relevant documents and arrange logistics. During the inspection, expert remote auditors deploy features like flashlight control to obtain better visibility in dim light, and augmented reality (AR) annotations to illustrate recommendations or identify potential problems. With the ability to capture and save photos from live video they can store visual records of equipment and processes alongside the inspection or audit documents. Previously, visits such as factory tours and inspections could take up to three days, entailing multiple visits. This was due to the requirement of reviewing relevant documents and certifications while on-site \u2013 something that can now be done with virtual inspections in advance. With less travel, simple coordination, quicker resolution times, and the ease of storing documentation, the number of inspections and audits conducted has skyrocketed \u2013 with the added benefit of a socially conscious company with a lower carbon footprint. Case Study 3: An international engineering and service company Note: Some of our clients prefer to remain anonymous while sharing their achievements. This client is an international engineering and service company employing over 60,000 personnel with 20,000 field engineers across 60 countries worldwide. It builds and services moving walkways, automatic doors, gates, escalators, and lifts. Committed to modernizing infrastructure in urban spaces, it has recently invested in new technologies like touchless building components and antimicrobial surfaces. Five years ago, this company launched a technical help desk (THD) to assist its technicians with field maintenance. It hoped to reduce the number of times second and third field techs were dispatched to a job site to troubleshoot an issue. It instead wanted technicians who were in training to call the THD and speak remotely with an expert when problems arose. If a solution could not be reached over the phone, a video call could be launched through the Salesforce platform. Of about 200 THD inquiries per day, the company estimated that between 8% and 10% used video calls, typically the most complex or challenging cases. The previous remote assistance supplier led to problems such as extensive setup time, limited Salesforce integration, and mixed user experience feedback. The client was eager to transition to a solution that also allowed the seamless integration of data collection in real-time with Salesforce. Integrated global data could then be analyzed to refine remote assistance processes, targeting situations and business areas needing improvement and driving greater operational efficiency. The client chose SightCall for its virtual assistance needs, attracted to its ease of integration with Salesforce. The company transitioned its 700 THD agents onto the platform within a matter of days and with zero interruptions. Once the need for a video call was determined case-by-case, an agent could assist technicians remotely through AR and AI tools. The calls were launched from within the technician\u2019s Salesforce console on their phone, without any need for additional apps or tools. With SightCall\u2019s advanced AR capabilities, agents harnessed tools like remote activation of the smartphone camera to illuminate dark spaces, direct annotation of items of interest by drawing or marking on the screen, and Smart Optical Character Recognition capturing text, barcode or QR codes for immediate transfer. Because the data from each session is instantly fed back to the Salesforce work order, with little to no button-clicking or manual syncing required, the client was also able to realize its goal of collecting information across different job types and curating it in a central database for strategic use. Within six months of deploying SightCall, the client saw a 19% decrease in its technician callout rate and a 50% increase in first-time fix rates, which now exceed 80%. For a company committed to improving its carbon footprint, the reduction in truck trips also created what one of its IoT architects called \u201ca huge leap forward.\u201d Transform Your Service Organization Using AR-powered visual support, your organization\u2019s most skilled technicians can handle more jobs remotely, giving them the freedom to focus on high-value customers, complex repairs, and supporting technicians in the field. SightCall\u2019s enterprise-grade visual support platform harnesses the power of AR to allow technicians to work at their maximum potential, regardless of their experience level or expertise.

To get the basics out of the way WebRTC (a.k.a., Web Real-Time Communications), a solution for video calling and video conferencing was originally introduced by Google back in 2011 as an open source project and has gained significant momentum in a very short time. WebRTC has been embraced by the W3C who are moving forward with a draft standard definition of an API supporting browser-to-browser applications for voice and video calling, conferencing and file sharing without plugins. Many enterprises are now looking into WebRTC to determine if it fits their needs. The following are five reasons to give WebRTC serious consideration as an enterprise communication tool. WebRTC is Easier to Integrate & Deploy Prior to WebRTC we had three choices when it came to making a video call: use a pre-packaged App like Skype, a cloud service like Go-to-Meeting, or implement a full blown unified communication platform. The problem with Skype, Go-to-Meeting, and the like are they are designed to be standalone services. To use these services the user would have to leave the context of their App and login to Skype or Go-to-Meeting. The call would occur out of context and the user was forced to jump back and forth between applications. They also had to duplicate contacts in multiple places and remember IDs and Passwords for each solution. These solutions also weren\u2019t designed to be integrated and rarely are in the enterprise. The third option, unified communications (think Cisco, Avaya, Microsoft Lync etc.) is very expensive to implement and very challenging to integrate. Most of these platforms require the purchase of both software and hardware. They also required specialized knowledge and skills to implement and integrate. The average company will typically hire a systems integrator to deploy the solution and most customers will not deploy all the pre-packaged functionality due to cost and effort. Only a fraction of enterprises deploying UC will actually achieve an integration with a 3 rd party application due to the learning curve and complexity of the integration layer. Most WebRTC solutions offer well documented APIs and SDKs and integrating the solution into an existing application normally requires only a few lines of code. Developers can look like heroes with a little support from vendors who often provide code samples to ease the learning curve. The time to integrate a WebRTC solution can be counted in days versus most UC solutions that cost more, take months to implement, and rarely get truly integrated into enterprise applications. Overcoming Consumer Mistrust Through Video Calling Amazon\u2019s commercial showing the Amazon Mayday button on the new Kindle Fire created a groundswell of interest in real-time customer support through video calling. Anyone who has sent an email requesting support and wondered if it was simply going into a black hole, or sat in a chat session wondering if anyone was on the other end, can easily see the advantage of real-time video support. It\u2019s simply reassuring to know there is someone there to help, and how better to reassure the customer that this is true then to put them face to face with the agent. Real-time video support offers a clear path to building customer satisfaction and loyalty. Support calls also get closed faster when the agent can communicate more directly with the customer. The real question is will consumers download a foreign browser plug-in or application onto their computer to let you support them? If your answer is no, don\u2019t despair your business is not alone. Consumers are conditioned to not trust businesses or any online entity for that matter during their first interaction. With WebRTC, businesses can offer real-time video support without causing consumer friction or drop offs because WebRTC enables secure video calling within a browser without any downloads. This technology is certain to usher in a new era of customer service which bodes well for the hundreds of millions of consumers in the world. Real-time Collaboration Through Video Enterprise collaboration is a very hot topic, as enterprises try to get their employees more engaged. The challenge for most organizations is that employees often work remotely, which is also why Mobile is high on the enterprise agenda. Less than roughly 68% of employees consider themselves fully engaged in their work. The lack of full engagement has a serious impact on productivity, and enterprise IT is attempting to address this with collaboration solutions. Most collaboration solutions attempt to bring consumer social media tools to the enterprise in an effort to get employees to engage like they do on Facebook or Twitter. Unfortunately, these text based solutions simply don\u2019t replace the connections employees built when they were all in the same location. Real-time video on the other hand brings back that sense of connection and gets employees out from behind the walls built by email and chat communications. WebRTC makes video calling and video conferencing viable options for many organizations and will quickly become the tool that makes the biggest impact in the effort to reengage remote employees. WebRTC is Secure Over time we\u2019ve realized that we have to be more conscious of how we protect our communications. When making a call we like to think our communication is secure, however most VoIP solutions still rely on the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) to facilitate calls. Contrast this with WebRTC which starts with Secure RTP (SRTP) as its standard. The basic premise of WebRTC is that every call is private, which is what consumers expect. SRTP provides authentication, encryption, and ensures the integrity of the call. It even embraces protection of replay. SRTP is considered a sister protocol to RTP, but for most VoIP solutions relying on RTP it takes a great deal of configuration and testing to make SRTP work. This is why many Unified Communication (UC) implementations end up settling for the less secure RTP. Building on a secure foundation as its default simply makes WebRTC the more secure solution for the enterprise. WebRTC is More Cost Effective For many of the traditional Unified Communications (UC) it\u2019s still about selling hardware. Hardware is what drives revenue in companies like Cisco and Avaya. Even UC vendors like Microsoft who are more software oriented are in it for the licensing revenue. For most UC solutions you can expect to pony up a fairly significant capital investment. Beyond the capital investment there is also the implementation and integration time. Most companies don\u2019t have internal expertise working with UC platforms, so they hire an integrator to do their initial implementation and custom development. This can double or triple the cost of the implementation. UC vendors will argue that you buy a UC platform for more than voice and video calling. If you look at the cost of just setting up a reliable video bridge on a UC platform it will far exceed the cost of most WebRTC deployments. One of the key mantras of WebRTC is that it is free; implement a few lines of code and you\u2019ve got video calling. This is true if all you\u2019re looking to do is talk to someone on your LAN browser to browser. Supporting a global enterprise with reliable video communications where employees are spread across multiple countries is another story altogether, and for this you\u2019ll need to build an infrastructure or use an existing Platform as a Service. Fortunately, there are a couple of vendors who offer Video Platforms as a Service that can be purchased for a very reasonable subscription rates eliminating a large capital outlay and keeping implementation costs to a minimum. Integration of WebRTC is required, but it isn\u2019t anywhere near the effort of integrating a traditional UC solution. Many companies are offering APIs and SDKs for developers. With WebRTC, developers can typically get away with writing a few lines of JavaScript for which the vendors provide code samples. In-house development teams can typically handle this level of integration keeping the cost of WebRTC much lower than that of traditional UC solutions. No matter how you look at it, WebRTC has a significant cost advantage over traditional UC solutions. WebRTC has no licensing cost, integration can be done with commonly available development skills, and infrastructures can be rented at low subscription rates. WebRTC eliminates the need for large capital outlays and delivers on its low cost promise.

Forty years ago, consumers seeking solutions to their problems faced a slow and sometimes painful process. It was normal to wait on hold for a customer service representative to answer your call, only to be met with a robotic script and unhelpful answers. Visiting in person was never fun because folks in the Complaints Departments were always cranky. And if things got really serious, your best (and only) option was a strongly worded letter. Words typed on paper. Sealed in an envelope. Delivered by a mail truck in 3-7 business days. Those days are gone. Thanks to new technology and changing expectations, the rules have changed. Customer service has undergone a complete transformation. Customers want solutions NOW. They want problems to disappear at the push of a button. They want to connect with your company whenever, wherever and however they choose. We\u2019ve combed the internet to collect some hard facts and numbers about the current state and immediate future of customer service. And while we might not be nostalgic for the slow, ineffective old ways of customer service, everybody has a soft spot for eighties music. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve infused this list with 40 classic tunes from the most rad decade for pop music ever. Since some of these revelations might be hard to swallow, we thought a spoonful of sugar (and maybe some Blondie) would help the medicine go down. 1. \u201cFaithfully\u201d \u2013 Journey 96% of consumers say customer service is an important factor in their choice of loyalty to a brand.

Juergen, can you tell us more about your role at Genesys? Juergen: Yeah, for sure. So I\u2019m taking care of the App Foundry Marketplace. That means the enterprise experience for our partners in the marketplace. So I make sure it\u2019s a continuously well-oiled machine for our resellers, our ISV partners, our account managers, but also for our customers. And I\u2019m taking care of the entire backend of that since the initial launch date of AppFoundry. Fred, can you tell us more about SightCall in the App Foundry? Fred: Sure. I\u2019m EVP of partnerships. For SightCall, I manage all partnerships and Genesys is one of our strategic partners. We are an elite App Foundry partner and we are bringing visual assistance to Genesys customer interactions. And we are one of the top partners, as Juergen says, so happy to be there. We are trying to drive more business together and we have still a lot to accomplish together. Can you talk more about the value of a strong partner ecosystem. Juergen: For sure. So a strong partner ecosystem is not just the partnership, you know, a logo exchange and signing some letters. That\u2019s the easy part. That\u2019s what everybody can do. For us it\u2019s really important that with the marketplace experience and with these partnerships, we are able to gain customer trust and loyalty. We want to provide choice and options to our customers. And with the marketplace experience, we want to provide a solution for every issue, which makes it on the one hand partially a little bit messy because you have lots of solutions in the marketplace. On the other hand, it makes it simple for customers to consume applications straight out of the marketplace. With that overview of multiple applications, we provide more collaboration, not just between customers and vendors, but also between vendors, between ISV partners, between ISV partners and resellers, and between resellers, ISV partners, customers, and our sellers. We see AppFoundry and the marketplace basically as a matchmaker platform. Think about Uber who brings taxi drivers and customers together. We do the exact same with ISV partners and customers. But we add one more portion to the whole thing\u2026 actually two. One is our resellers\u2026 and one is our own sellers, so our own account executives can actually help our customers to consume applications out of the marketplace. Fred: So if I may add to what Juergen said, the marketplace is a great place for customers to find solutions to enhance the Genesys solution. But it\u2019s also a great place for them to buy and consume solutions. It\u2019s an easy way for them to buy solutions from partners. Right, Juergen? Juergen: Exactly. Can you help us understand more about that turning point for service organizations that make the big change from on-prem to cloud? Juergen: The turning point\u2026 Well, when you look at it from a 20,000-foot level, I think ultimately it\u2019s the reduction of costs. But I think it\u2019s also the implementation of higher standards, providing higher stability, providing better service levels. It\u2019s also a reduction of carbon footprint, because when you put more things to the cloud, your physical footprint is going to be smaller. At the same time, the more industries are going into the cloud, the more they collaborate within the cloud and the less carbon footprint we actually use as human beings, which is amazing in itself. And of course, it\u2019s also the reduction of head counts. It\u2019s the reduction of redundancies. As I said, it\u2019s better stability because you get better standards out of the cloud. You get all the advantages of a marketplace because you can simply plug things together within the cloud. And you can, as a contact center in particular, switch faster to new endeavors, to new events. You can react faster on special occasions. You can faster implement shifts and strategies. These are multiple turning points for customers and for different industries to switch from on-premise to the cloud. It\u2019s way more safe. It\u2019s way more reliable. And ultimately, it\u2019s way faster to adopt new technologies. Visit SightCall on the Genesys AppFoundry Marketplace Fred: When it comes to CX and digital transformation, do you see the move from on-premise to the cloud being equal in the US and in Europe? Juergen: I think, you know, with GDPR, the European folks are a little bit slower with their cloud adoption compared to North America. There is a ton of fear, uncertainty, and doubt. I love to make the example of a friend of mine. He\u2019s creating reports for the pharmacy industry and needs to make sure that the medicine is actually validated and FDA approved. When he sees that the entire cycle is being managed through a cloud-based infrastructure, he can tick all the boxes in his checkpoint list when it comes to reliability, redundancy, all these things in the cloud because all of that is already being taken care of. And the same applies to Genesys, right? As we are based on AWS, our customers don\u2019t need to worry about all these things such as redundancy, stability, making sure that the air conditioning is turned on and not accidentally switched off. In on-premise solutions, all of these things are just available in the cloud and that makes things way easier. However, as you said, Fred, that\u2019s exactly right. In the EU or in Europe, we do see a little bit more resistance, but that resistance is going down because ultimately, there is no other opportunity than going to the cloud. Of course, you still have lots of people who are saying, \u201cNo, I would stay on-premise forever.\u201d But I think because of the buzzword\u2014 and I\u2019m still not saying it \u2014it becomes more or less impossible looking into the future to adjust to all these upcoming challenges. When you see this buzzword AI coming up, you think, \u2018Yeah, that\u2019s the future.\u2019 It\u2019s not. It\u2019s there, it\u2019s built-in, and we provide it in a turnkey solution. Juergen Tolksdorf Speaking of the buzzword\u2026 You can\u2019t have a CX discussion these days without mentioning AI. So how are customers leveraging Genesys AI to design better solutions and consistently improve their customer experience? Juergen: So let me kick off with Genesys and what we do with AI. I mean, we have tons of options. We have chatbots, we have voice bots, we have agent co-pilots. We have predictive routing. We have a perfect blend of digital and voice with knowledge management, all AI-enabled. AI doesn\u2019t stop there. It\u2019s also built on conversational intelligence, forecasting and planning, quality assurance, performance management, work automation, and task routing. I don\u2019t want to tick all the boxes we provide, but in fact, we do it. And all of that is AI. It\u2019s incredible even for myself, you know, I\u2019ve been with Genesys for a pretty long time now, almost 20 years. But when you see this buzzword AI coming up, you think like, \u201cYeah, that\u2019s the future.\u201d It\u2019s not. It\u2019s there, it\u2019s built-in, and we provide it in a turnkey solution. And we just don\u2019t provide AI as a turnkey solution, we expand it through the App Foundry, letting partners in who embrace AI and who actually add more capabilities to our solutions, such as SightCall. Fred: When we are collecting information during a visual assistance call or video call, we can bring all this information to Genesys so we can apply AI on top of the information we collected. So that\u2019s, I think, the most important thing when we are talking about the integration. It\u2019s not only the power of our AI or AR engine on SightCall but it\u2019s the fact that we are bringing information to the Genesys cloud and they can run AI also on top of this. Fred: As the director of the App Foundry, the marketplace of Genesys, you\u2019ve already accomplished a lot in terms of program, infrastructure, and the number of partners. What\u2019s next for what you envision for App Foundry in the coming years? Juergen: So we don\u2019t want to become the next Google, right? Where we just pull everything into the marketplace and customers can search but also have the burden on their shoulders to find the right solution. I think we will see, not just in AppFoundry, but in marketplaces in general, better curation. We will see better recommendations. We will see better tailoring to customers\u2019 needs. Because, it might sound bold, but Genesys powers thousands of customers worldwide today. We know exactly what challenges these CX providers are facing. We know by heart what a good customer experience center is. And this is in our bones on a daily basis. So that\u2019s why we will be better at providing a marketplace experience that is tailored to customer needs so that customers can actually see, \u201cHey, I\u2019m right now in my customer experience journey. I\u2019m right now here. I could do these things. I could apply video for particular cases like Nespresso did.\u201d And I\u2019m not tired of mentioning that business case because it\u2019s genius, in fact. I love it, seriously. When you have a piece of hardware and you want to provide customer service to it, why not enable video in case something doesn\u2019t work the way it\u2019s designed\u2026 to allow the customer to get a quicker resolution? That\u2019s exactly what we are looking for when we\u2019re looking to the future of the marketplace experience. Fred: SightCall has been a Genesys partner for three years, right? And we are already super proud to be an App Foundry partner, an elite App Foundry partner among the top 20 of your partners. We have many joint marquee customers together. Why do you think we are seeing such success with Genesys? And I think that I\u2019m asking that question because it can be beneficial for current and future App Foundry partners, right? Juergen: I think you did something extremely well. And I take this as an example everywhere I\u2019m asked about it. You tailor your solution to particular customer needs. I was talking to Thomas Cottereau, I don\u2019t know, about 10 years ago when he had his ideas around SightCall. He was already successful with it with lots of customers already. You have a clear vision and you execute among that vision. Your tailored business case speaks to customer demand, not just, \u201cHey, here\u2019s a piece of technology\u2026 you can hit this button, that button, that button, and you get different variations of whatever we provide.\u201d You are saying, \u201cThis is what we do, this is what you can achieve with this, and this is why we make your customers happy.\u201d And that is a true differentiator. That\u2019s what everybody understands within three minutes. And I think that\u2019s what gives you success.

We\u2019re saying goodbye to the old days of cubicle mazes, hardwired phone systems and the buzzy chatter of a hundred headset conversations happening at once. Technology gives companies and customers the ability to connect whenever and wherever they please. Virtual storefronts can stay open 24-hours a day for 365 days a year. Cloud connectivity allows agents to support remotely from any place on the planet. And service organizations can now deploy armies of AI-powered chatbots, digital self-service automations and vast libraries of support resources designed to solve problems quickly. But every year it seems like resignations are on the rise. The average turnover rate for contact center employees varies by region and industry, but historically ranged from 30% to 45%. In 2023, research showed the average yearly turnover has reached 60%. In some cases, especially in high-stress environments, turnover can climb as high as 70% or more. So why are contact center agents still burning out and heading for the door? And what can you do to keep them around? The \u201cBig E Words\u201d are Anything But Easy Efficiency. Empathy. Experience. You hear those words often in conversations about optimizing contact center performance. They are loaded terms that represent big ideas and even bigger ideals. Getting those three right is like winning the CCaaS Triple Crown. It\u2019s not exactly easy, but it can feel downright impossible when your contact center is locked in an endless game of musical chairs. That\u2019s why it might help to add another \u201cBig E Word\u201d to the mix: Empowerment. As a contact center leader, you may be skeptical. \u201cEmpowerment\u201d conjures all kinds of ideas of individual freedom and autonomy that don\u2019t really fit in with the scripts, standards and processes that are central to running a well-oiled customer service machine. But the point isn\u2019t to toss the script, abandon the rules and let everybody wing it. You run a contact center, not an improv class. The first dictionary definition of empowerment focuses on the handing over of authority and power. But focus on the second, the one that mentions empowerment as \u201cthe process of becoming stronger and more confident.\u201d You empower people when you give them the ability to win. And for customer service agents, winning is all about solving problems. The High Cost of Low Morale Allow me to tell you three things that you already know: 1. People don\u2019t leave jobs that they love. 2. People enjoy winning. 3. People dislike losing. Why waste words stating the obvious? Because it\u2019s easy to forget that for customer service professionals, the job has pretty clear definitions of victory and defeat. Customer calls with a problem. Agent solves the problem. Victory! Customer calls with a problem. Agent CAN\u2019T solve the problem. Defeat! Is that a wildly oversimplified version of reality? Sure. But it\u2019s hard to overstate the impact of job fulfillment on attrition. Every day, agents deal with intense pressure from: High call volumes Difficult customers Performance metrics Repetitive work Lack of control And last, but certainly not least\u2026 Emotional labor Emotional labor is a term coined by sociologist Arlie Hochschild in her 1983 book, The Managed Heart, and refers to the process of managing emotions to fulfill the emotional requirements of a job. For agents, it involves regulating both their own emotions and expressing the appropriate emotional responses during interactions with customers. We\u2019re all aware that interacting with customers all day can be exhausting, but how often do you consider the emotional acrobatics that agents have to perform on every call? They\u2019re expected to remain cheerful and calm, even in the face of frustration and anger. Leadership evangelizes empathy, which requires agents to go even deeper into the mindset and feelings of the customer. On top of all this, support professionals are required to leave their own emotional baggage at the door. This daily emotional tug of war can do a number on someone\u2019s physical and mental health. Prolonged stress is draining and leads directly to increased burnout and turnover. So how do you even begin to deal with something so complex? Managing someone\u2019s emotional state sounds more like a job for a counselor or psychiatrist. Can\u2019t you just focus on running a high-performing contact center? In a perfect world, maybe, but in this one, you can\u2019t have one without the other. That\u2019s why it pays to give your contact center staff everything they need to win. 3 Keys to Reducing Emotional Labor Here\u2019s my suggestion: Focus on three easy wins. They call it emotional labor because most of the time, it\u2019s describing a struggle to stay positive in the face of negativity and frustration. It\u2019s hard work to smile when you fall short. If agents can\u2019t give customers what they want (a solution), then nobody wins. The customer is unhappy and the agent has to pretend to be happy. It\u2019s clear that the inability to solve customer problems is the problem. So make it EASIER for agents to find a solution. Give agents a clearer view of the problem. Humans are visual creatures. We learn, communicate and digest information faster when using pictures and video (up to 60,000 times faster than by reading text alone). Adding a visual component to your customer service arsenal can speed problem-solving and put customers at ease by replacing a voice or text with a friendly face. Give agents faster, easier access to answers. Seize the opportunity presented by Generative AI to transform your knowledge base into a more intuitive and accessible resource. If you\u2019re still sending agents on epic quests for support documents, manuals and troubleshooting guides, you\u2019re making it harder on everyone. Give agents a daily sense of doing good. Agents will feel more confident and capable with every interaction when they have the tools, technology and tactics that help them solve faster. \u2014- As contact centers continue to evolve with technological advancements, the human element is more crucial than ever. Despite AI and automation enhancing efficiency, the emotional toll on agents remains a key cause of high turnover. Leaders must prioritize empowerment and support to nurture a healthier, more sustainable work environment. By reducing emotional labor with strategic resources, organizations can enhance job satisfaction, boost morale, and significantly lower the risks of burnout and attrition. Ultimately, a focus on the well-being of agents is not just a good practice\u2014it\u2019s a vital strategy for thriving in the competitive landscape of customer support.

You\u2019ve seen those big, burly guys outside of the hottest night spots, right? They stand blank-faced, with their arms crossed and accept zero nonsense. You want to be like them. But instead of keeping riffraff out of the VIP areas, you\u2019re defending your company and customers from mishandled information, data breaches and AI hallucinations. A recent study by IBM\u2019s Institute for Business Value showed that 94% of C-suite leaders consider the security of AI solutions a top priority. But it also reported that 69% put innovation ahead of that same security. And while 47% saw Gen AI as a tool to \u201chelp improve the time to detect and respond to cyber threats,\u201d the exact same percentage were \u201cconcerned that adopting Gen AI in operations will lead to new kinds of attacks.\u201d We\u2019re in uncharted territory when it comes to AI. That\u2019s why a bit of extra caution goes a long way. As a \u201cbouncer\u201d you can\u2019t waive solutions through the front door just because Gen AI is famous, and everybody\u2019s heard of it. You have a responsibility to serve and protect\u2026 and that starts with asking lots of questions. 15 Key Questions CCaaS Leaders Need to Ask Gen AI Vendors Evaluating software solutions has always required a fair share of due diligence. But the addition of generative AI adds fresh anxiety to the already complex CCaaS tech landscape. It is easy to get seduced by the bold promises of AI. Contact center leaders are under constant pressure to improve metrics and deliver results. Few can resist the idea of virtual assistants that work all day and night at lightning speed. But it\u2019s critical to understand how you can put customer information and company data at risk. First, start with these three internal questions\u2026 What specific tasks or issues will gen AI address? Set objectives that align with business goals. Will you use AI for customer service automation, content creation or decision support? Treat Gen AI like a new employee. Give it a job description with responsibilities and expectations. How will Gen AI integrate with our existing systems? Will your solution connect seamlessly? Or will it need a workaround? Consider APIs, data exchange protocols, and the modification of existing workflows. How will we train and provide support for staff using Gen AI? Ensure your teams understand how to use the technology. This should include discussions about compliance and security. Once you understand how AI will fit your business goals, it\u2019s time to build a list of questions for AI vendors. Your list may vary, but here\u2019s a solid dozen to get started: Ensure Data Protection and Privacy Compliance Understand how Gen AI handles and processes sensitive customer information, including personal and financial data. Compliance with regulations such as GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA (if dealing with health-related information), and other relevant data protection laws is crucial. How do you ensure compliance with global data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA. HIPAA)? Why it matters: Compliance protects your organization from legal penalties or damage to its reputation. Strong compliance features demonstrate a vendor\u2019s commitment to privacy and security. Can you detail the data encryption methods used during data transmission and at rest? Why it matters: Asking about encryption practices for data in transit (as it\u2019s sent) and at rest (when stored) evaluates a vendor\u2019s ability to safeguard sensitive customer information. What policies and procedures do you have in place for data access and how do you ensure that only authorized personnel can access sensitive information? Why it matters: Make sure that the right people have the right access for the right reasons. Effective control is crucial for minimizing the risk of data breaches from both external attacks and internal threats. Minimize Data Handling and Storage Risks The risk of data breaches is a significant concern when integrating Gen AI into your call center operations. It\u2019s important to understand what security measures are in place to protect against unauthorized access, hacking, or other cyber threats. Where is the data stored, and what are the physical and logical security measures in place at these locations? Why it matters: Knowing the physical and logical security measures of data storage locations ensures that the vendor\u2019s facilities adhere to high-security standards. Do you utilize public, private, or hybrid cloud services for data storage, and how do you ensure their security? Why it matters: Understanding the cloud infrastructure used (public, private, hybrid) is key to evaluating the potential risks and security measures needed. What policies and procedures do you have in place for data retention and deletion? Why it matters: Effective data retention and deletion policies help manage the lifecycle of data, ensuring legal compliance and reducing the risk of retaining unnecessary sensitive information. Take Control of AI Model Training and Maintenance Model training and maintenance are crucial for ensuring that customer interactions remain efficient, personalized, and effective. Regular training updates keep the AI models relevant and accurate to changing customer behaviors and preferences. How do you ensure the security and privacy of data used in training your AI models? Why it matters: It\u2019s important to make sure that customer data used for training AI models is not exposed to unauthorized access or misuse. Securing training data also builds trust that customer information is handled responsibly. What measures are in place to prevent biased outcomes from your AI models? Why it matters: Bias in AI models can lead to unfair or discriminatory outcomes, affecting customer satisfaction and causing reputational damage. Ask about bias mitigation strategies to ensure that AI models provide equitable and fair service. How do you manage updates and maintenance for AI models to ensure they remain effective and secure over time? Why it matters: AI models need to evolve. Regular updates and maintenance are crucial to maintain the longevity and effectiveness of AI solutions in dynamic environments. Maintain AI Transparency and Explainability AI isn\u2019t perfect. Mistakes will be made, and you\u2019ll need to understand why. Get clarity on how decisions made by the AI are derived, particularly for sensitive customer interactions. The ability to audit and explain AI decisions is crucial for accountability, troubleshooting, and compliance. Can your AI system provide explanations for its decisions or outputs? Why it matters: Transparency in AI decision-making is crucial for building trust with users, fulfilling regulatory requirements (such as GDPR\u2019s right to explanation), and identifying potential biases or errors in the AI system. What level of detail do the explanations include, and are they accessible to non-technical stakeholders? Why it matters: Explanations must be detailed and understandable to non-technical users, including customer service representatives and customers themselves. How do you ensure the AI system remains explainable as it evolves with further training and updates? Why it matters: Continuous explainability is essential for long-term trust and compliance, ensuring that the AI\u2019s decision-making process remains transparent, even as the system grows more sophisticated. Strive for Innovation, Commit to Security The integration of Gen AI into CCaaS environments requires a meticulous approach to security and compliance. Like vigilant bouncers guarding the gates to exclusive venues, CCaaS leaders must rigorously evaluate potential Gen AI solutions to protect data integrity and customer privacy. Given the rapid evolution of technology and the novel threats that come with it, you need to stand firm. Stay tough. Accept zero nonsense. Because as we venture further into the era of Gen AI, the burden of responsibility lies with CCaaS leaders. It\u2019s up to you to ask the right questions and educate yourself (and your staff) to ensure that the drive for business innovation does not outpace the commitment to information security.

Here are ten best practices for agents using video technology during customer engagement: 1. Prepare and Test Equipment Before engaging in video interactions, agents should ensure that their video equipment, such as cameras, microphones, and internet connection, are in good working order. Test the equipment and troubleshoot any issues beforehand to avoid interruptions during the customer engagement. Watch how SightCall makes it easy. 2. Choose a Suitable Environment Select a quiet and well-lit environment for video interactions. Make sure there are no distractions or background noise that could interfere with the conversation. A professional and distraction-free setting helps maintain focus and provides a better experience for the customer. 3. Dress Professionally Agents should dress appropriately and professionally when engaging with customers via video. Dressing professionally helps establish credibility, trust, and a positive impression. Avoid wearing casual or distracting attire that might detract from the conversation. 4. Maintain Eye Contact Look directly into the camera to establish eye contact with the customer. This helps create a more personal and engaging interaction, similar to an in-person conversation. Avoid looking at the screen or being distracted by other elements in your surroundings. 5. Be Mindful of Body Language Non-verbal cues play a significant role in communication, even through video. Maintain an open and attentive posture, use appropriate hand gestures, and be mindful of facial expressions. These gestures can convey engagement, empathy, and understanding to the customer. 6. Use Clear and Concise Communication Ensure that your communication is clear, concise, and easily understood. Speak at a moderate pace, articulate your words, and avoid using jargon or technical terms that the customer may not be familiar with. This helps prevent misunderstandings and promotes effective communication. 7. Engage Actively Actively engage with the customer by listening attentively and responding appropriately. Demonstrate active listening by nodding, acknowledging the customer\u2019s concerns, and paraphrasing to confirm understanding. Encourage the customer to ask questions and provide feedback throughout the interaction. 8. Be Patient and Empathetic Show patience and empathy during video interactions, as you would in face-to-face interactions. Be mindful of any potential technical issues the customer may face and offer assistance when required. Display empathy and understanding towards their concerns or frustrations to build rapport and trust. 9. Provide Visual Aids and Demonstrations Utilize the video platform\u2019s capabilities to share visual aids or demonstrate products or services when necessary. This can enhance understanding and provide a more interactive experience for the customer. Ensure that any shared content is relevant, clear, and supports the customer\u2019s needs. 10. Follow Up and Document After the video engagement, follow up with the customer as needed and document the interaction appropriately. If any action items or next steps were discussed, ensure they are recorded accurately and promptly. Following up helps reinforce the customer\u2019s confidence in your support and demonstrates your commitment to their needs. See how SightCall makes follow-up effortless with our seamless integrations. By following these best practices, agents can enhance the customer experience, build stronger relationships, and effectively leverage video technology during customer engagements.

Empathy and a strong human connection rank as top priorities for customers. People want to be seen, heard and understood. If they have a problem, they want it solved. Empathy is more than problem-solving with feelings \u2013 it involves connecting with customers on a deeper level, recognizing their emotions, and responding with understanding and care. In customer service, companies that prioritize empathy foster stronger connections, build more trust, and encourage lasting customer loyalty. Why Build an Empathy Strategy? Empathy is more than a soft skill; it\u2019s a strategic asset. Customers who have a positive emotional experience with a brand are much more likely to become repeat customers. There\u2019s also a tangible impact on the bottom line. As studies have shown, companies that excel in delivering empathetic customer experiences grow faster than their less empathetic counterparts, often by significant margins. According to research published in the Harvard Business Review, the top 10 companies in the Global Empathy Index in 2015 increased in value more than twice as much as the bottom 10 and generated 50% more in earnings. Another recent study found that companies that excel in customer experience (CX) outgrow their competitors in revenue by a factor of 2. Technology Can Facilitate Empathy Technology is often associated with automation and efficiency, but it can help call center agents arm themselves with a deeper understanding of any given customer\u2019s emotions and needs. It helps them focus on the person behind the problem. From AI-powered sentiment analysis to advanced communication channels, there are technologies that help agents better understand and connect with customers on a human level. Empathy Tool #1: Informed CRM Systems Every customer has a history. But nobody likes rehashing the past and customers get frustrated when a company\u2019s memory comes up short. Customers need you to understand where they\u2019ve been to help them get where they want to go. Advanced analytics and customer relationship management (CRM) systems allow businesses to gather and understand vast amounts of customer data. CRM systems compile data from chat transcriptions, phone interactions, direct mail, and social networks, which provides customer-facing staff with detailed information on purchase history and previous service concerns. By leveraging this information, customer service agents can approach customer queries armed with valuable insights into customers\u2019 preferences and pain points. Empathy Tool # 2: NLP and Sentiment Analysis What if your agents knew going into a service call not only what the issue was, but how the customer was potentially feeling? Reading emotional tone is crucial to providing solid CX. Natural Language Processing (NLP) and sentiment analysis technologies enable organizations to assess the emotional tone and sentiment behind previous customer interactions. NLP is an adaptive AI technology that gives computers the ability to interpret, comprehend, and respond with more natural human language. Sentiment analysis is an NLP function that can analyze customer feedback as positive, negative, or neutral, and by understanding the customer\u2019s emotional response and not simply their purchase history. Empathy Tool #3: Omnichannel Communication Today\u2019s customers expect seamless and consistent experiences across multiple channel options. The advent of advanced communication channels such as live chat, social media, and chatbots allows for real-time and continuous engagement. An omnichannel approach allows customers to connect with you through their preferred channel, be it via phone, email, chat, or social media. By leveraging technology that integrates and synchronizes customer interactions, agents can access a customer\u2019s complete history, enabling them to provide a personalized and empathetic service experience. Having a centralized database enables a living history for each customer, ensuring that agents aren\u2019t making customers repeat themselves in search of solutions. Empathy Tool #4: Multimodal Generative AI and Augmented Reality Augmented Reality (AR) technologies and emerging multimodal generative AI offer exciting possibilities for empowering agents to provide immersive customer experiences and make the unspoken spoken. Multimodal AI can digest multiple data inputs\u2014including text, video, speech, images\u2014to create a more holistic (and human) understanding of the customer and their needs, as mined from varied sources. AR technology is also capable of providing real-time troubleshooting guidance through visualizations, thereby showing the customer how to address a problem rather than simply telling \u2014effectively reducing miscommunication and even bridging language barriers. Leverage Empathy to Build More Personalized Experiences There are lots of stories about companies that have gone above and beyond to deliver exceptional service. Zappos is famous for being obsessed with customer satisfaction. Their tales of the \u201cbest man\u2019s shoes\u201d and the \u201c10-hour service call\u201d have become CX legends. And the way online pet supplier Chewy emotionally connects with customers is making lifetime fans, melting hearts and raising the bar for corporate empathy. But while those examples certainly give companies something to aspire to, the best first step is improving your customer experience. One big key to that is personalization. Make your customers feel like people from the start and it will work out much better for everyone in the end. In building SightCall VISION, our goal was to create a service solution that feels almost effortless. Our thinking is that a more visual platform delivers a much better customer (and agent) experience and gives your team the tools to embrace a more empathetic kind of customer service. We believe that: Empowering customers with self-service options is better than putting them on hold. Seeing problems helps them get understood and solved faster. Engaging people face-to-face builds trust and improves communication. By embedding empathy in customer service strategies, enterprise companies can create more personalized, engaging, and satisfying experiences, leading to increased loyalty and advocacy.

Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence designed to produce original content, ideas, or data\u2014often mimicking human creativity in the process. It\u2019s like a creative machine that functions by collecting samples and patterns of information and uses its research as a springboard to create content on its own. These original creations can be anything from text and entire conversations (like Chat GPT or Google\u2019s Bard) to images (like DALL-E or Midjourney) and music (like Amper Music or Splice). Generative AI can even be used for complex problem solving, employing its algorithms to quickly explore potential solutions and narrow down viable options to save time. It can provide valuable data insights to guide strategic decisions by analyzing customer interactions, which allows businesses to identify areas for improvement and emerging trends. Transforming Customer Service with Generative AI In today\u2019s dynamic business landscape, customer service has evolved beyond a mere support function\u2014it\u2019s a strategic driver for business success. A whopping 86% of consumers worldwide say a company is only as good as its service, and with the rise of artificial intelligence and automation, enterprises are discovering the immense potential of generative AI in revolutionizing support services and increasing customer satisfaction. Let\u2019s explore how generative AI can significantly improve operations in your enterprise customer service contact center. 1. From Data to Dialogue: Personalized Customer Interactions Every customer\u2019s experience is unique, and Generative AI can analyze massive volumes of customer data to craft personalized interactions. By understanding past behaviors, preferences, and purchase history, AI can generate tailored responses that resonate on a deeper level. This level of personalization enhances customer engagement and satisfaction by reminding customers that they are not merely being weighed as customers but as individuals. 2. AI Assistants: Automated Responses and Chatbots Intelligent chatbots powered by generative AI can handle routine queries and issues 24/7. These bots can provide instant responses, route inquiries to appropriate agents, and even help resolve simple problems autonomously. This not only reduces response times and the number of on-call agents needed for CX services, but also frees up human agents to focus on more complex issues. 3. Speak their Language with Multilingual Support In our globalized business landscape, enterprises dealing with a diverse global customer base can struggle with language barriers. NLP, or natural language processing, is a generative AI technology that can understand and process language and instantly translate queries and generate responses in multiple languages. This ensures seamless communication with customers from all corners of the world, enhances your customers\u2019 satisfaction and expands the company\u2019s reach. 4. Boost First Contact Resolution (FCR) Customers worldwide prioritize an efficient and timely resolution to their problem above anything else. Generative AI can equip agents with real-time information and suggestions, improving their ability to resolve issues during the first contact. By providing accurate and relevant information, AI boosts the chances of successful FCR, leading to happier customers and more efficient operations with fewer transfers between departments. 5. Decipher Sentiment and Emotion Let\u2019s face it, people need to feel heard\u2014 31% of consumers in the past year stopped using a company after a negative interaction with the company\u2019s service center. Generative AI can analyze customer sentiment based on customers\u2019 tone, word choice, and context, helping agents to gauge customer emotions accurately and respond empathetically. Addressing emotional needs increases the likelihood that customers will trust your enterprise with their business again. 6. Virtual Training Ground: Prepare Agents Better Generative AI can assist in training agents by simulating customer interactions. This provides a risk-free environment for agents to exercise handling support challenges and refine their skills before interacting with actual customers, accelerating the learning curve and solidifying a quality baseline for customer service. 7. Predictive Insights for Proactive Customer Service In a world dominated by digital interactions, the ability to analyze and predict based on historical data is invaluable. By analyzing historical data, predictive AI can anticipate potential issues, trends, and customer behavior, allowing generative AI to get to work on enabling proactive measures\u2014such as addressing common problems before they escalate and designing targeted marketing campaigns based on past customer preferences. 8. AI as Content Creator Generative AI can aid in creating and updating content for knowledge bases, FAQs, and email templates, thereby empowering customers with fast, accurate access to answers. This also ensures that agents have access to up-to-date information, which in turn leads to a more specific and consistent CX experience\u2014the more your agents are empowered with solutions, the higher the level of service they can provide your customers. 9. Continuous Improvement Practice makes perfect! Generative AI can learn from experience, and by analyzing its own customer interactions and identifying patterns, refining its responses over time, this iterative learning process leads to continuous improvement in the CX experience. Generating a Path Forward for CX Incorporating generative AI into customer service contact centers isn\u2019t just a trend\u2014it\u2019s a strategic move that can lead to tangible improvements in customer satisfaction, operational efficiency, and business growth. As AI technology continues to advance and a growing number of customers prioritize efficient and substantive customer service as a requirement for doing business, embracing generative AI becomes a key and necessary differentiator for enterprises aiming to excel. Are you ready to harness the power of Generative AI for your enterprise? The future of customer service is here, and it\u2019s automated, personalized, and more efficient than ever.

One of the most significant time wasters in call centers occurs during the initial moments of contact, as agents work to collect preliminary information from customers. Who are you? Why are you calling? Which product and model are you calling about? These are the most basic questions, the ones that must be answered before support can move forward. But what if you could do away with those introductions? What if customers could provide that information before the call is accepted? What if agents already knew the answers and could use that context to get a head start on every call? What if you could streamline every step of support by giving customers the ability to identify themselves, their products, and their issues\u2026 BEFORE speaking the first word to an agent? Empowering Customers with Self-Identification SightCall enables you to create a simple and completely customized digital process that customers can use to self-identify and provide information before engaging an agent. Prompts to submit preliminary information can come through auto responses from live chat or interactive voice response (IVR) systems. Right from their smartphone or tablet, customers can click a link to provide essential details about themselves, their products, and the specific issues they are facing. Instead of taking up time spelling their last name or trying to read the fine print on a hard-to-locate serial number sticker, customers and agents can get right to making things right. \u201c67% of customers prefer self-service options.\u201d \u2013 Zendesk Seamless Integration for Enhanced Efficiency Our solution is designed to work where (and how) you work. SightCall seamlessly integrates with your call center software. We understand that the key to improving overall efficiency starts by collaborating and communicating with the biggest enterprise software platforms and tools. API is in our DNA. All of that pre-call customer information is instantly uploaded to your customer support system, eliminating the need for agents to manually collect and input data. By automating this initial step, you can significantly improve efficiency and allocate your agents\u2019 time more effectively. \u201cOrganizations that automate data capture processes experience a 50% reduction in average handling time.\u201d \u2013 Forrester Intelligent Call Routing for Personalized Support With SightCall, you have the power to leverage your own routing rules to ensure that each call is directed to the most suitable agent for the specific issue at hand. This level of intelligent call routing enhances the customer experience by connecting them with agents with the right expertise. It also reduces wait times and minimizes transfers. \u201c83% of consumers prefer dealing with knowledgeable agents who can resolve their issues in a single interaction.\u201d \u2013 Accenture Deflection Capabilities for Time and Cost Savings Automatically deflecting calls will reduce the burden on agents and save valuable time. Utilizing self-service options and leveraging the pre-call information provided by customers, makes it easier to resolve issues without the need for agent involvement. Your team can avoid calls altogether that are about the wrong brand, non-service related questions or inquiries better handled by sales. This self-service runway not only streamlines the support process but also enables your agents to focus on the most complex and critical customer inquiries. \u201cOrganizations with self-service capabilities have experienced a 10% increase in customer satisfaction rates.\u201d \u2013 Aberdeen Group Every Second Counts Time is money in the call center industry, and even small time-saving measures can have a significant impact on your bottom line. Cutting just two minutes from every support interaction through the implementation of SightCall, could translate to millions of dollars in savings every year. Shorter call times allow agents to handle more calls within a given time frame. This increased efficiency means that fewer agents are needed to handle the same call volume, resulting in reduced labor costs. \u201cReducing call handle time by just 10% can result in annual savings of up to $1.4 million for a contact center handling 500,000 calls annually.\u201d \u2013 ICMI Elevate Customer Experience with SightCall In the highly competitive consumer goods industry, delivering exceptional customer service is paramount. By seamlessly integrating customer self-identification, automating data capture, and enabling intelligent call routing, SightCall empowers agents to understand the full context of each call and resolve issues more efficiently. SightCall equips call center managers and leaders with the tools to transform their operations and provide a superior customer experience. By implementing self-identification processes, leveraging data integration, and optimizing call routing, you can streamline your call center, reduce costs, and enhance customer satisfaction.

He didn\u2019t bring home a new HD TV because he was looking for a challenge. He invited some college friends over to cheer on their alma mater in the playoffs. All Dave wanted was a bigger screen and a clearer picture. He didn\u2019t count on five pages of schematics in three different languages with a pop quiz on router hardware and network connectivity. Dave wanted this to be easier. But a lack of resources on the company\u2019s website sent him down a YouTube rabbit hole to nowhere. The chatbot keeps asking him to call technical support. And after waiting on hold for 20 minutes, the call quality is so poor that he has to read out the serial number three times before the agent apologizes that she will have to call back. She never does. Dave thinks, if this is the level of service he has to look forward to, he should have gone with the other brand. He wonders, \u201cHow hard would it have been to make this process much easier?\u201d The Power of Smart Installation and Setup In the era of smart homes and connected devices, our relationship with consumer goods is undergoing a remarkable transformation. Technology has given us exciting new ways to interact with everything from speakers and thermostats to doorbells and lightbulbs. We can control and monitor more of the products we own with the push of a virtual button from our tablets and smartphones. It makes sense that consumer goods companies extend this advanced intelligence and convenience to the installation and setup journey, ensuring that customers have a seamless and empowering product experience. That\u2019s why more brands are leveraging technology to guide buyers through the post-purchase process, streamline product registration, and provide dynamic installation resources. Smart installation and setup can absolutely transform the customer experience, leading to improved engagement and long-term loyalty. A More Convenient Start to Customer Relationships Smart installation and setup offers customers a seamless and user-friendly experience right from the start. By guiding buyers through the installation process using digital instructions, companies can ensure that customers feel empowered and confident in setting up their new products. The idea is to update the traditional experience of paper manuals and instructions with a more intuitive digital (and visual) experience that guides customers step-by-step. Keeping engaged with your customers post-sale signals a willingness by your company to create (and maintain) a relationship that lasts. It shows your customers that your company is invested in their ongoing satisfaction. Streamline Product Registration and Data Capture One of the key advantages of designing a smart installation process is the ability to streamline product registration and capture valuable buyer and device data. By leveraging digital self-service workflows, customers can easily register their products with a click of their smartphone camera, eliminating the need for cumbersome manual data entry. This not only saves time for customers but also enables businesses to gather essential insights for future service interactions. By ensuring that they collect this vital information up front, companies gain a distinct advantage when it comes to following up with customers on everything from service requests and recalls to surveys and upsell offers. Since the return rate for printed product registration cards has historically lingered between 5% \u2013 25%, it\u2019s safe to assume that more convenient, \u201cpoint-and-shoot\u201d methods using QR codes or optical character recognition (OCR) will trend higher. And customers will surely appreciate NOT having to locate and recite (or type) an impossibly tiny 10-20 digit serial number any time they call with a service issue. \u201c73% of consumers expect companies to understand their unique needs and preferences based on past interactions.\u201d \u2013 Salesforce Empower Customers with Dynamic Installation Guides The era of the paper manual is coming to a close. These days, even the humble PDF is getting an upgrade. Dynamic installation guides are proving to be a game-changer when it comes to helping customers successfully set up their products. Going digital (and interactive) allows a company to present a library of resources such as checklists, diagrams, product-specific manuals, and even animated instructional videos. Businesses can equip customers with the tools they need for a seamless installation experience at a fraction of the cost of printing on paper. And digital instructions give companies the flexibility to update and amend information as needed. Customers who have easy access to answers aren\u2019t as inclined to reach out via phone call or email for basic questions, which frees up agents for more urgent service calls. \u201cOffering comprehensive self-service options can reduce call center volume by up to 30%.\u201d \u2013 McKinsey & Company How Can Companies Get Started with Smart Installation? Leveraging SightCall\u2019s visual support and process automation solutions into your installation and setup process can take your customer service to a whole new level. Because SightCall connects seamlessly with asset management and CRM systems, it\u2019s easy to ensure that every future service interaction is more efficient and personalized. Demographic and ticket information gets where it needs to go from the start, eliminating the need for manual entry into different platforms. Seamless Escalation to Live Video Support Inevitably, there will be times when customers require additional assistance during the installation process. With SightCall, customers can easily create support tickets or escalate to a live video support call without leaving the installation workflow. This streamlined approach reduces customer frustration and ensures an effortless transition from self-service to personalized support\u2026 and back again. The Future of Smarter Customer Service with SightCall By embracing smart installation and setup powered by SightCall, companies can transform the way customers engage with their products. Leveraging smart technology, such as digital instructions, dynamic installation guides, and integrated video support, can enhance customer satisfaction, reduce support costs, and foster long-term loyalty. According to Temkin Group, loyal customers are five times more likely to repurchase, four times more likely to refer, and seven times more likely to try a new offering. Those numbers make investing in technology to gain loyalty sound like a no-brainer. In today\u2019s competitive landscape, providing a seamless and empowering installation and setup experience is vital to winning and retaining customers. If you\u2019re ready to embrace the future of smarter customer service with SightCall, and unlock the full potential of your customers\u2019 relationship with your products\u2026 we\u2019re here to help you get started.

Today, all those people and companies who pay for products and services expect more than ever before. When things go wrong, customers just snap their fingers and expect someone will come running to fix whatever\u2019s broken. Don\u2019t they understand that companies are busy doing business? Don\u2019t they get that companies have other things to do besides cater to their every need? This whole \u201cservice with a smile\u201d thing can get overwhelming and, frankly, exhausting. Modern customers get it in their head that just because they give a company money, they are automatically in a RELATIONSHIP. Sometimes, call centers and agents just need a break. But customers can be hard to shake and that\u2019s why any company looking for peace and quiet needs to learn how to break up with buyers for good. Luckily, customers are ridiculously easy to get rid of. Just follow any of the following proven steps and those phones will quit ringing no time. 1. Treat loyal customers like total strangers. The next time a customer calls for help, pretend you have no idea who they are. It doesn\u2019t matter if they\u2019ve communicated with you dozens of times before, treat them like a stranger. Ask them for their name, address, phone number\u2026 all that stuff that they ASSUME you should already know. They hate that. You can do it online too. Just avoid using smart forms, so that any time (and EVERY time) they fill out a form on your website, they have to start from scratch. Does marketing automation make it easier than ever to \u201crecognize\u201d existing customers and returning visitors? Yes. Should you do it? Only if you want customers to have a great experience. But if you\u2019re looking to drive them away, surveys show that not recognizing them can help you drive away between 80% and 91% of consumers! 2. Make them wait\u2026 and wait. This one takes ZERO effort on your part. Simply redirect all incoming calls, texts, or chats to some sort of limbo/purgatory and then relax. As the minutes tick away, those customers will be gone quicker than you can say, \u201cOur agents are currently busy with other calls.\u201d Research shows 60% of customers believe 1 minute is too long to wait on hold and about a third of survey respondents said they shouldn\u2019t have to wait on hold AT ALL. So if you manage to keep callers holding on the line long enough to hear an entire smooth jazz cover of a 1970s soft rock pop hit, you\u2019ll probably never see them again. 3. Don\u2019t offer self-service or automation options. More customers are interested in finding solutions on their own. Don\u2019t make it easy for them. The last thing you want to do is point them to any self-service tools or resources they can use to diagnose and solve issues without your help. The same goes for automation. Any process that allows customers a convenient and automated way to submit requests or check on the status of parts, service appointments and product updates? Get rid of it. Studies show that 67% of customers prefer self-service, so the best way to alienate people is to ignore that trend. Customers stay when you make support easier. They leave when you turn service into an obstacle course. 4. Eliminate customer convenience. Speaking of effective customer service practices, you\u2019ll want to steer clear of omnichannel. Omnichannel is a nightmare because customers can get in touch any time (and any way) they want. Don\u2019t fall for it. Providing a universe of support options like chat, email, social, or video is a surefire way to drive yourself crazy. Instead of convenience, offer your customers only one way to communicate during a very narrow window of time. If you are a global company, you can drive even more business away by ignoring things like language barriers and time zone differences. The harder you make it for them to communicate, the less you have to hear from them. There are few more effective ways to get rid of your customers than by limiting their options and eliminating their freedom of choice. 5. Stop solving customer problems. If you want them gone and gone for good? Don\u2019t solve their problem. It\u2019s as simple as that. People crave resolution, so don\u2019t give them what they want. You can do this any number of ways: Pass them around to your colleagues like a hot potato until they give up Give them a series of impossible obstacles and tasks until they give up Stall, fumble and repeat\u2026 until they give up. The best part about this tactic? Once they\u2019re gone, they\u2019ll spread the word about their bad experience. According to Zendesk, 95% of customers who have a bad experience will share their experience with others. If you work hard to deliver bad customer service, all that ill will is bound to pay off. People talk and stories circulate. And once you get famous for falling short on service, that will mean fewer new customers that you\u2019ll have to manage! 6. Don\u2019t adapt your service model. You really want to get rid of customers? Don\u2019t adapt. Don\u2019t embrace technology. Stick with the broken and busted old ways of service. Don\u2019t pay any mind to facts, statistics, and fancy buzzwords like \u201cCustomer Experience.\u201d Ignore make-believe concepts like \u201csatisfaction,\u201d \u201ctrust\u201d and \u201cloyalty.\u201d And while all those other companies are running like lemmings off the cliff called \u201cThe Future of Customer Service,\u201d you just stay put. If you are REALLY serious about getting rid of your customers? Just stay the course and do nothing to change, grow or improve. The future will take care of itself.

As host of The Future of Field Service podcast, she engages in weekly conversation with field service professionals who work on the front lines, behind the scenes and everywhere in between. Sarah\u2019s interview style is perfectly suited for digging into the day-to-day details and challenges of service organizations. Her episodes cover the trends and topics that really matter for companies faced with transforming the way they connect with customers. If you\u2019re looking for all-access into the minds of the world\u2019s most successful service leaders, all you need to do is hit PLAY. We were curious to hear Sarah\u2019s take on the current state of field service and how leaders and teams can get ready for everything that comes next. So we called her on the phone and asked her to start from the beginning\u2026 What was it about field service that got you interested? It happened serendipitously. I was in grad school getting my MBA when I got a job as a writer for a company that publishes a variety of B2B industry publications. I was randomly assigned to the publication that I ended up running, which was called Field Technologies. When I started, I didn\u2019t really know what field service was. It\u2019s a hard thing to define. As an industry, we still battle with that a bit. When I got my first few assignments, I honestly thought, oof, this is gonna be boring. What changed that thought? I have an innate curiosity. All of the content I\u2019ve done has primarily been focused on interviewing service leaders about their challenges, initiatives, transformations, lessons learned, et cetera. And when I started talking with people, it was at the beginning of a whole lot of evolution. The industry was starting to recognize the potential of service as a profit center versus a cost center. It was the beginning of shifts in how technology was leveraged and the start of digital transformation as we know it today. That brought on a lot of the change related to focusing on customer experience and the role of the frontline workforce. The fact that things were starting to shift, helped me quickly get perspective on how much potential there was and how cool of a journey it would be. How did you go from Field Technologies to the podcast? I had the desire to do a podcast for a while. I loved the pressure of running a print publication. I thrive in a deadline based environment for sure. But I always felt like I was having these great, long conversations with leaders who had so much wisdom. Then I\u2019d have to go through the process of editing all that wisdom into something that fit into a four or five page article. It was a hell of a lot of work and I felt like I was leaving so much on the table. When I was approached by IFS to start The Future of Field Service, I knew it would be a really good opportunity to bring those conversations to life. People could take away what was most relevant to them, rather than me picking and choosing the bits that would end up in an article. We started with the website and weekly articles to get things going in January of 2019. Four months later, we launched the podcast and we\u2019ve done one a week ever since. I think seeing and hearing people on the podcast also adds a layer of humanity that sometimes gets lost in B2B conversations. Yeah, and I also think the pandemic changed the way we show up to work in a more human form. That shift has allowed the podcast to get into some pretty personal conversations. Not every episode is \u201cHow did you do X, Y, or Z?\u201d and \u201cWhat have the benefits been?\u201d There\u2019s certainly a place for that, but I also have a lot of conversations that get into leadership mentality and approach, vulnerability, and mental health in the workplace. Things that are very real in the lives of, not only the leaders I\u2019m interviewing, but the people they work with. I\u2019ve really enjoyed that. What do you see as the biggest opportunities for field service? I think I\u2019m still here because a lot of the potential in field service remains unrealized. And it\u2019s not because that potential is unrecognized. It\u2019s because of all the layers of change it takes to really evolve and modernize service. Leveraging service as a revenue generator and brand differentiator takes time. It\u2019s really exciting that there\u2019s still a lot that can be done with the move to deliver outcomes instead of products and services. For some organizations, that change has to do with shifting the business model, which I think is a really interesting conversation. Customer expectations continue to evolve and expand, and the industry\u2019s ability to meet those needs differently is exciting too. The idea of incorporating a remote-first service model and leveraging more automation is intriguing. And doing so not to reduce the work for the field technicians, but to change what that could look like to be more customer-centric. Also, and this is not necessarily specific to field service, but I think we\u2019re in the midst of a new era of leadership. There are a lot of cool things that come up in conversation that I think are indicative of a whole lot of opportunity, still to be uncovered. What about challenges? To a large degree it all points back to change, right? And change is hard. I just finished recording a podcast with Kristoffer Brun, Service Operations Product Manager at Electrolux, who talked about how much courage transformation really takes. And that\u2019s really true. I think for many leaders and many organizations, complacency holds a lot of appeal. For lots of different reasons. There are always going to be challenges. Right now it\u2019s economic turmoil and pressure. There\u2019s the challenge of attracting and retaining talent. And as companies become more customer-centric, how do they manage costs without sacrificing the customer experience or the employee experience? Because as we\u2019ve become more and more customer-focused, a lot of companies have overlooked the correlation between their employee satisfaction and their customer satisfaction. I think there\u2019s a lot of work to be done digging back into that. What do you see in terms of technologies that have had the most impact? I think from a technology standpoint, there\u2019s a huge degree of sophistication available to companies today. But I think what technology providers sometimes fail to realize is that just because it\u2019s there, doesn\u2019t mean everyone is ready to use it all right this minute. I think the real change we\u2019re going to see from a technology standpoint is in the end users catching up to the technology. When I started, it was a lot of assembling a bunch of different things together. Today that\u2019s not as necessary. More functionality is available in a way that can be a lot easier to manage and maintain. So the challenge starts with just getting onto these modern platforms, and then looking for the practical uses for the capabilities that exist. I think AI and machine learning and augmented reality all hold a lot of potential. But they require a strong foundation. I think some companies are still working on getting that strong foundation in place. There was an era when modernization and transformation meant moving from paper to digital. But right now, it\u2019s about foundation and establishing a solid, capable platform on which to build these more sophisticated capabilities. You travel and have conversations with service leaders from all over the world. Are there similarities and differences in how these companies are handling service challenges? Digital transformation and the journeys, challenges and opportunities companies face are very similar. Change management? Absolutely the same. Talent gap, very similar. Maybe it\u2019s because of the premise of the platform I run that I look for similarities, but I believe that global companies have much more in common. The differences pale in comparison to the commonalities. Is there a misunderstanding about field service? Well, it\u2019s an industry that\u2019s hard to explain and I think that\u2019s the challenge, right? Defining it clearly is a big part of what you need to do to get people interested in field service careers. The tricky part is that it\u2019s not AN industry. It\u2019s a lot of industries. It\u2019s complex. I definitely don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve nailed it. What further complicates things is that field service continues to evolve. If you talk about appliance repair or commercial equipment repair, people tend to visualize what that job looked like 10 or 15 years ago, not necessarily what it\u2019s becoming today. Do the most successful service leaders (and companies) have qualities or attitudes in common? I think there are a couple of things. The companies that are leading the way when it comes to realizing the potential of transforming service? They have a leadership mentality that is enthusiastic about the possibilities that come with change. They are able to look at the potential, not just the problems, that will arise during the transformation. That\u2019s one thing. And when we talk about managing change, I think the biggest difference between people who are getting it right and people who aren\u2019t, is that the people who are getting it right listen more than they speak. They truly take the time to understand what the stakeholders need. And when we think about field service transformation, I\u2019m thinking primarily about the workforce, but depending on the type of transformation, it can also be the customers. Industry leaders are aware that to be successful, requires a lot more input than just their own. And they\u2019re willing to spend the time getting that input and they respect the voices, views and needs of other people. In the end, they can put a solution together that meets those needs, instead of just forcing something. Okay, one last question. You mention your love of hip-hop in your bio, so I have to ask, what rappers are in your heavy rotation? I would say primarily classic stuff. Nineties era hip-hop is my comfort zone. I\u2019m not opposed to newer things, but I definitely tend to get in my car and put on something from that era versus looking for the new stuff. I\u2019m pretty open to different artists, but my cornerstones are artists like Jay-Z, Biggie, Nas and Wu-Tang Clan. I hate sounding like one of my parents when I say \u201cThey don\u2019t make it like they used to.\u201d But I\u2019m hard pressed to think of someone super recent who I think is incredible. At this point, when it comes to new stuff, I\u2019ll need to rely on my children to force me to modernize my musical tastes once they get a little older.

Just ask Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph, the co-founders of Netflix. In early 2000, Hastings and Randolph walked into Blockbuster\u2019s Dallas headquarters. They were there to make a bold partnership offer to CEO John Antioco. The pitch from the upstart Davids to the six billion-dollar Goliath went like this: They believed the future of movies was online. If Blockbuster paid $50 million for Netflix, Hastings and Randolph would develop and run Blockbuster\u2019s online video rental division. But Blockbuster CEO John Antioco didn\u2019t see it. He balked at the price and declined the offer. Netflix has since become the second largest entertainment company on the planet with over 230 million subscribers worldwide. Blockbuster declared bankruptcy in 2010. Blockbuster certainly wasn\u2019t alone in underestimating the importance of the world wide web. But they became a cautionary tale for companies dealing with change. The future knocked on Blockbuster\u2019s front door and Antioco yelled at it to get off his lawn. Why? Because comfortable people don\u2019t want to change. In 2000, Blockbuster was king of the hill. The company was owned by Viacom and operated 6,500 stores worldwide. From Antioco\u2019s perspective, things were pretty darn good. Why should he worry about new technology, when the way Blockbuster had always done things was working just fine? Why should he risk being uncomfortable? Why change? Granted, introducing new technology to your service team isn\u2019t the same as pitching multi-billion-dollar companies on bold new ideas. But sometimes it can feel just as daunting. Making the Case for Change Selling others on the potential of new technology is asking them to take a leap of faith. You\u2019re asking employees to trade what they know for something unknown. You\u2019re asking them to zig when they have always zagged. People don\u2019t like stepping out of their comfort zones. And they really don\u2019t like being pushed. When it comes to workplace change, the numbers aren\u2019t pretty: 45.6% of employees experienced information overload during a change ( Gartner ) 70% of all change programs fail due to employee resistance and lack of management support ( McKinsey ) 73% of employees affected by change experience medium to high levels of stress ( Gartner ) Most companies struggle with getting veteran field service engineers on board when new technology is introduced. And it\u2019s easy to understand why. Experienced employees have habits and routines. They know what works for the way they work. We all get why they might be hesitant, even suspicious, of changing their current methods. Change can be risky and most service professionals are overwhelmed as it is. The day-to-day work of clearing tickets and closing jobs is challenging enough. That\u2019s why it might help to talk more about adaptability and resilience. They need to understand that new technology isn\u2019t just about changing processes and improving productivity on the front line. Digital transformation has the potential to make the entire company more efficient. In a 2011 article for Harvard Business Review, Martin Reeves and Mike Deimler described adaptability as a huge competitive advantage for companies: \u201cIn order to adapt, a company must have its antennae tuned to signals of change from the external environment, decode them, and quickly act to refine or reinvent its business model and even reshape the information landscape of its industry.\u201d In other words, change is coming and only the most adaptable will survive. The good news is that there are proven ways to win over skeptics, convert cynics and get your entire service team behind the adoption of new business tech and tools. Here are some solid strategies to help employees lower their digital defenses and embrace new technology: Involve them in the decision-making process Involving veteran field service engineers as early as possible in the process is worth the effort. Not only does it help them feel valued and invested in the technology\u2019s success, but their input is essential since they will likely be the primary users. Create a cross-functional team. Include veteran field service engineers and other stakeholders involved in the selection process, such as IT personnel, procurement, and project managers. Conduct field tests. Involve veteran field service engineers in field tests of the new technology. They can provide valuable feedback on the technology\u2019s usability, reliability, and effectiveness in real-world field service scenarios. Seek their feedback. Ask veteran field service engineers for their feedback on the technology. This can be done through surveys, focus groups, or one-on-one meetings. Their insights can help identify issues and opportunities for improvement. Highlight the benefits Nobody gets excited by change for change\u2019s sake. Explain how the new technology is designed to make THEIR job easier, save THEM time, or improve THEIR individual performance. Highlight the advantages of the technology and how it will positively impact their work. Bonus points for eliminating the paperwork and administrative tasks that the Service Council recently identified as the #1 least favorite part of a field service engineer\u2019s day-to-day job. With SightCall, everything is done with the touch of a button. No more writing down long serial numbers just to reenter them into another system. One simple barcode scan and model numbers can be captured, identified and recorded to a central system for continued lifecycle maintenance. Imagine how much time could be saved if we eliminated the pen and paper and duplicate entry after the site visit? 70% of companies stated that \u201cusing tech to simplify workflow and manual processes\u201d to reduce costs is the utmost priority in the future. ( Open Text ) Provide real training Give them genuine guidance and a plan for mastering new tools. Offer training sessions that cater to different learning styles and provide hands-on experience with the new technology. This will help the engineers feel more confident and comfortable using it. SightCall can make this easier by putting important information like maintenance guides, installation instructions, and step-by-step diagrams in front of a technician or service agent automatically without having to search the web for it. Enlist early adopters Encourage collaboration between veteran field service engineers and early adopters of the technology. This can help build a sense of community and encourage knowledge sharing. Facilitate regular communication. Create a forum where both parties can exchange ideas, discuss challenges, and share insights on how to improve the technology. This can be done through regular meetings, online forums, or collaboration tools that allow for real-time communication. Encourage knowledge sharing. Encourage veteran field service engineers to share their expertise and knowledge with early adopters. They can provide valuable insights into the industry and the specific challenges that the technology is intended to address. Early adopters, in turn, can provide feedback on the technology and help to identify areas for improvement. SightCall video makes it easy to \u2018phone a friend\u2019 when you get stuck. Change is here to stay Nothing about change management is easy. Avoiding the hard work is not an option. As research from Gartner confirms, \u201cChange is the new constant.\u201d It\u2019s not going anywhere, so service organization leaders need to continue to help their teams adapt, evolve and embrace the digital tools that will keep them competitive in the years and decades ahead.

While it can be a challenge to introduce disruptive technologies into your service organization, a few key steps can smooth the process. It is essential to take time to build an augmented reality (AR) project that will bring more value to your organization, backed by specific goals, realistic predicted outcomes and reasonable timeframes for achievement. With this framework in place, it then becomes time to strategize on how to \u201csell\u201d the project to your people. Human nature is to fear the unknown, and what we fear, we resist. Employees need to understand how digitization will benefit them as they carry out their daily jobs. Communicating the positives and overcoming psychological and behavioral barriers to efficient implementation means using a change management model, a framework of methods to foster change around internal processes. Change management includes how to prepare and support your employees, as well as how to define and monitor all the necessary steps to successfully execute organizational shifts. In the 1940s, the renowned psychologist Kurt Lewin developed one of the most widely used change management models, which closely guides the recommendations given in this piece. He identified the three key stages of change as \u201cunfreezing,\u201d \u201cmovement\u201d and \u201crefreezing.\u201d[1] The first softens existing habits and modes of operation, the second activates change, and the third sets new, reformed modes into place. Consider that by introducing a total game-changing technology like remote visual assistance, you\u2019re asking people to redefine the work they\u2019ve been doing for years. To be successful, companies must execute a structured and repeatable process that will help their employees engage, adopt and change their day-to-day work and habits. Here are four ideas, influenced by change management theory but adapted for the unique needs of digital transformation, that can help get you there. Lay the Ground by Identifying Leaders and Champions This is an essential step before starting the \u201cunfreezing\u201d phase. Successful change management programs have visible leaders and champions who can be approached with questions and ideas, as well as for support. These leaders regularly communicate with teams and help motivate them. Identify which teams and individuals can help lead the charge to integrate visual assistance into their daily processes. Adopt different strategies for different roles and personality types within your teams. Although the benefits of visual support to the company might be clear, be sure to communicate how it will help the employees using it every day. Using relatable examples when introducing new processes helps users clearly understand the benefits and will increase adoption. Examples might be that visual assistance will help them reach their goals or targets more quickly or reduce repetitive tasks. Creating internal materials like a video demonstrating the software and explaining how it reduces common pain points can introduce it as a helpful resource. Unfreeze Behaviors Through Excitement and Motivation Generating excitement with rewards, recognition and good-natured competition work best when paired with clear expectations of what the new process is and how to use it. Providing additional coaching by pairing more resistant teams with established champions helps set the stage for success. Another approach to motivation during change management is rewarding employees for using the new processes and tools. This could be through gamification, such as establishing a leader board or setting challenges, or by adding incentives like gift cards or lunch to individuals or teams that meet their adoption goals. While these methods can be successful, rewards like these often lack the context around the expectations for using new technology. Where and when should people use it to get the rewards and what are the bigger benefits beyond a place on the leader board? Sometimes companies might motivate adoption of a new technology such as visual assistance by setting and enforcing clear expectations and targets. This might mean ensuring compliance by adding to an individual or team\u2019s formal objectives and evaluations. At its most extreme, bonuses or promotions can be withheld. This kind of motivation is extremely unsuccessful and can lead to stronger resistance and undermine the entire change management process. Change By Connecting the Project to Existing Business Processes A business process is a collection of linked tasks that find their end in the delivery of a service or product to a client. Redefining this to include visual assistance is key to increasing the \u201cstickiness\u201d of the new tool. Counterintuitive as it may seem, connecting your digitization to processes that already exist is essential to produce lasting change. To successfully integrate visual assistance, you should first ensure that the technology can embed directly within the CRM or FSM that employees are already using. There\u2019s nothing more frustrating than introducing a new tool that requires a separate interface or manual entry of information in two different places. The second is mapping visual assistance to existing business processes. Companies that successfully deploy visual assistance take the time to identify where it will fit within existing processes. Identify common problems that can be solved without a truck roll, for instance. Create specific documentation on how and when to initiate a visual support session. Once you\u2019ve implemented these, the next steps in the change management process outline best practices on how to motivate and train your teams and measure your success. Refreeze By Prioritizing Dynamic Training Research shows it can take two months to change a habit. When users are confident about their ability to use a tool, it becomes part of their \u201cdaily DNA.\u201d How you train them is directly correlated to how successful your rollout will be, and the permanence of the change you\u2019re looking for. Instead of providing a demo alone, you can \u201ctrain the trainer\u201d to make the path to adoption and enablement quick and easy. Even the greatest training sessions will be improved by letting participants know what to expect and why they are there. Provide a few short clips and information for your teams to review before training to establish content. When they arrive for training, they should know why the organization has invested in visual support and what the training is beforehand. Allow time during and after training sessions to let users practice with friends, family or colleagues. And make sure everyone knows who to go to with questions and support after training. Measuring the Success of Implementation Throughout your rollout process, you\u2019ll want to measure the adoption and progress of your implementation, as well as your business value and return on investment (ROI). These are two distinct but equally important indicators of a successful implementation. Internally, you should measure your efforts by looking at how many and how often employees are using visual assistance, in addition to what percentage of addressable calls are being handled with visual assistance. In other words, out of all the problems you could be solving with visual assistance, how many are resolved with the new tools and processes? It is key to establish a good monthly average user metric to aim for and measure it over time. Measuring the ROI and cost savings for the organization at large is extremely important to establish the true business and financial value of visual assistance. Establish your metrics early on and be sure they take into consideration any additional costs visual assistance might impact. If the goal is reduced truck rolls, for example, don\u2019t forget to factor in savings on parts wastage and service vehicle maintenance and repairs. One of the most powerful tools you have in calculating and promoting the value of visual assistance is to talk directly to your end-users. When someone has a big success or a great story, make it visible both internally to reinforce your efforts and externally to market your solutions to new and existing clients.

Buyers want fast, personalized service tailored to their preferences and budget. To stay relevant, brands must constantly find new ways to connect with customers. In the fast-paced cosmetic industry, one beauty giant has led the way in digital transformation. For decades, L\u2019Oreal has prioritized the use of new technology to improve consumer experience. Their innovation continued even during the COVID-19 pandemic. When salons were closed and customers had no access to in-person hair services, L\u2019Oreal had to find new ways to engage with customers and counteract lessening sales. L\u2019Oreal pivoted quickly with the help of Salesforce and SightCall to create virtual beauty consultations that allow customers to meet one-on-one with a cosmetic consultant and collaborate on a personalized beauty experience. How does it work? From within Salesforce Service Cloud, a beauty expert can initiate a SightCall video session. Meeting one-on-one lets experts walk customers through products and guide them in selecting and experimenting with hair color using L\u2019Oreal\u2019s AI-powered Virtual Try-On feature. During the session, any shared information is saved to the Salesforce case file, giving L\u2019Oreal the ability to offer future product recommendations tailored to the customer\u2019s preferences. That context helps increase repeat business. Offering customers a virtual way to experiment with hair color during the pandemic, opened new revenue streams for L\u2019Oreal and allowed them to connect with customers and grow sales, despite the unusual circumstances. Virtual beauty consultations are still in demand, and customers can now walk themselves through selecting a hair color with L\u2019Oreal\u2019s Virtual Try-On tool. Partnering with SightCall and Salesforce, enabled L\u2019Oreal to recreate the in-store experience online, and ensured customers had access to products and professional beauty consultants no matter the circumstances. With this new method of engagement, L\u2019Oreal was empowered to scale their support to the customer\u2019s needs and provide a consistent positive experience along each step of the buying journey. \u201cSince launching its virtual consultation service, the company has seen a 336% increase in number of virtual try-ons for its L\u2019Oreal Paris hair dye.\u201d Learn More at Salesforce Don\u2019t Let Years of Wisdom Walk Out the Door Connect with us today to build a plan for capturing knowledge and reducing revenue loss Get a Demo Get Connected!

The day-to-day task of fielding inquiries, troubleshooting and building solutions to issues in the moment plays a significant role in the relationship your company and its brand builds with customers. This, in turn, forms what is perhaps the leading element of quality control. Call centers typically deal with metrics like first-time issue resolution and average time to repairs, both of which help a company determine how effective its agents and systems are at giving customers what they need the first time around, without the need for duplicate questions or multiple site visits. Less-than-ideal service encounters, particularly in sectors like insurance or utilities, where someone is reaching out during a stressful situation, carry a high risk of that customer walking away from a company or provider, never to return. This, combined with increasingly stringent and demanding expectations from auditors and regulators, are leading companies in numerous sectors to explore how digitization can maximize the effectiveness of their contact centers and the key performance indicators within them. This article explores the role of visual assistance \u2013 a technology combining live video communications, augmented reality, artificial intelligence, and digital process automation \u2013 in achieving contact center optimization. What does a contact center do? The contact center is a centralized hub to receive, manage and respond to customer inquiries and to perform troubleshooting. The agents who work there often act as the customer\u2019s first or second meaningful interaction with the organization. Contact centers are categorically split between business to business (B2B), business to customer (B2C), and internal help desk models. In general, all are powered by customer relationship management (CRM) platforms, which include Salesforce, Zendesk, or Genesys \u2013 all of which are integrated with our own platform at SightCall. A B2B contact center focuses on improving and maximizing client experiences. The use of a technical helpdesk, for example, can provide assistance on even the most challenging repairs, narrowing a company\u2019s call-out rate and increasing response times. A B2C contact center focuses more on customer experiences, such as reducing the number of product returns, getting tasks done the first time, and bolstering customer satisfaction and retention. The evolution of customer service The concept of customer service has existed one way or another since the first Industrial Revolution. But needless to say, things have changed dramatically in the succeeding centuries. The economic and supply chain impact of events like two world wars, several recessions and a depression, and global health emergencies like COVID-19 \u2013 not to mention technologies developed both within and alongside them all \u2013 have reshaped it. Customers today demand high-quality service and want to take advantage of the latest technology to solve problems in times and places that are convenient to them. If they have problems, they want them solved immediately \u2013 not in hours or days, let alone longer. In practice, this looks like not having to wait for a technician to be dispatched to their houses or businesses to troubleshoot or fix a piece of equipment. This is especially true in the business-to-customer (B2C) model, where customers frequently need to take time away from their jobs to wait for a technician to stop by their home. When a company decides it wants to not simply tweak, but rather transform the way its contact centers handle requests and dispatches, this is referred to as contact center optimization. What is contact center optimization? Optimizing your contact center involves realizing the highest caliber of customer service, at the lowest possible cost for the organization. Because everyone\u2019s target KPIs will be slightly different based on where they are, the respective goals for improvement will be different. But a few qualifiers are consistent with successful optimization: Faster call resolution rates Less time spent per customer A higher number of customers served per day Lowering customer service costs internally Increased customer satisfaction levels Increasing sales if the contact center upsells Faster agent training Improved agent retention and job satisfaction The goal, put more simply, is to maximize what the agents see and the number of cases they can handle, while also delivering a more rapid, personalized service to the customer themselves. With the right preparation, augmented reality-powered visual assistance is the most suitable solution to help enterprises do this. How can AR-powered visual assistance help with contact center optimization? By using visual assistance technology, an enterprise can ensure that its agents see what their customers see in real-time. It is a much more immersive way for the agent and customer to connect, and mutually troubleshoot or resolve an issue. While any video platform could be used in theory to complete a visual assistance session, platforms enhanced by the latest technologies make the experience even more powerful and transformative for customers. Augmented reality (AR) is one such tool. AR is the enhancement of an interactive, virtual component onto a real-world environment or situation, layering tools like informational text and 3D graphics on top of a user\u2019s field of vision. With the use of AR, an agent can solve customer issues faster by seeing what the customer sees, versus needing to dispatch a technician to a customer\u2019s home or business, entailing more time and resources. The SightCall platform integrates seamlessly within contact center workflows and works in harmony with existing systems and processes to maximize the service department\u2019s impact. The result is greatly improved first-time resolution rates, the ability to serve more customers per day, and a lessened need for in-person travel to triage a problem or fix a broken or non-functioning piece of equipment. Specifically, our internal data shows the use of augmented reality is capable of achieving: An 81% growth in first-time fix rates. A 69% reduction in time to issue resolution, and a 50% reduction in truck rolls. Knowledge savings through a 41% decrease in training time. Customer satisfaction increases by as high as 30 points. And SightCall visual assistance can help a few more areas of a service business. Performing pre-visit triage and assessments Even in the event that a technician does need to be dispatched to tackle a particularly complex issue, the company can still remotely assess a customer issue to determine what tools and expertise are needed for a successful first time fix. Enabling self-guided installations For customers who want to perform certain tasks themselves while still being closely guided by instructions, augmented reality and artificial intelligence guidance can empower a customer to install their own devices or perform simple troubleshooting. How can digital process automation help with contact center optimization? The definition of digital process automation (DPA) is the use of technology to optimize workflows by automating processes within them. Because those processes are more standardized, this results in improved enterprise performance and reduces errors that traditionally prevent businesses from achieving their best results. Digital process automation is straightforward, both in implementation and use, especially for the customers. DPA is ideal for building self-guided experiences or journeys for customers that give them the ability to solve their own problems and engage in their own service activities, such as registering warranties. The business can then collect data from customers that allows them to improve service encounters with successive customers. SightCall\u2019s own Digital Flows solution allows tasks to be completed with no ambiguity or confusion. This saves contact center agents a tremendous amount of time by having customers use their smartphones to enter basic information like their name, address, phone, and serial numbers. With this in place, an agent can focus on immediately helping the customer, instead of doing basic data entry, making the customer repeat their stories, or asking repetitive questions. Digital Flows also ensures contact center agents complete all the required procedures in the correct order, and have their work automatically documented and saved in their CRM. This is especially crucial to stay compliant with regulations and avoid fines for even simple mistakes. Case Study: How iFIT realized a more efficient and responsive contact center The mission of iFIT Health and Fitness is to empower a more active, balanced lifestyle for all. iFIT owns established industry-leading fitness brands NordicTrack, ProForm, and Freemotion, which offer connected fitness membership services powered by iFIT, an immersive live and on-demand streaming fitness and wellness media platform with more than 700,00 paid subscribers. As early as 2017, iFIT recognized the power of remote visual assistance ( read iFit case study ) to increase satisfaction for their customer service agents and improve the customer experience. By partnering with SightCall, iFIT was able to streamline the process for repairs and troubleshooting for in-home equipment with a visual assistance solution that integrates with their CSM system and empowers their agents to help customers get the most out of their home fitness equipment. iFIT quickly deployed SightCall for Salesforce to all contact center agents, eliminating the need for long phone calls to try and understand a problem. Agents can initiate a SightCall session directly from Salesforce via text or email link with a customer to immediately see and discuss the issue. Photos and videos are saved directly to the Salesforce platform, speeding up the approval process for replacement parts or repairs for equipment under warranty. Using visual assistance has improved both agent and customer satisfaction, increased first-time fix rates, and reduced the number of incorrect parts ordered and shipped. Now, average resolution time has decreased significantly for all 800 agents, saving up to 4,000 hours per week. Agents with the highest usage of SightCall place the least amount of service technician requests \u2013 resolving 95% of their cases without the need to schedule an in-person visit. This dramatically increased efficiency has allowed iFIT to scale its customer help center adding hundreds of new agents. In addition, over 85% of customers surveyed said they liked their experiences with live visual assistance support. With lower training time also having resulted, new agents are able to onboard quickly, gaining familiarity with different brands and models by seeing them firsthand during their interactive video sessions with customers. Agents also have access to knowledge articles and resources that can then be shared with the customer with one click. In the event a technician visit is required, first-time fix rates are vastly improved by visual assistance. And correctly identifying the problem and the parts needed through a SightCall session reduces the need for multiple visits. Abundant and useful data has also been supplied to the iFIT quality engineering team. All photos and video from a SightCall session are saved into the CRM, meaning that recurring problems can be identified easily without wading through notes and call logs. With a simple search, quality engineering teams can access all reported problems with a particular piece of equipment or component. They share these comprehensive reports with manufacturers and research and development teams to guide improvements that benefit all future customers. A stronger contact center is your key to success and customer loyalty There is a direct relationship between call center performance and your bottom line, unsurprising when you consider that this is often the most consequential interaction a prospective customer \u2013 or a stressed, existing one \u2013 will have with you. Research from our partner Genesys\u2019 State of Customer Experience suggests as high as 54% of consumers value first contact resolution in customer service interactions. NewVoice Media reports that 56% of customers will never use a company again after experiencing poor service. As a result, there is a significant incentive to engage in process optimization in your B2B or B2C customer support department. Smooth and seamless experiences are thereby more memorable, resulting in personal and business customers alike being more likely to turn to your service organization in stressful and uncertain situations.

The definition of augmented reality (AR) is the enhancement of an interactive, virtual component onto a real-world environment or situation, layering tools like informational text, 3D graphics atop a user\u2019s field of vision. The adoption of AR has seen exponential growth over the last several years, with more than a billion global users projected in 2022 alone. AR has the potential to create more digitized, efficient and safer environments for workers. In the power and utilities industry, where working in hazardous environments is relatively common, advanced technologies like this can help team members navigate the physical conditions around them, improve service delivery and decrease the downtime of essential equipment that customers rely on. There are numerous general benefits to the adoption of augmented reality technologies in the workplace. These include: The ability to perform actions on mobile devices and instantly receive relevant information with enriched, real-world objects. The use of devices to record real-world measurements that can be sent directly to a customer relationship management (CRM) system or case file. Placing digital AR tools on top of objects in the real world, helping to show service technicians how to perform tasks. Being guided in the field by a remote expert, even through complex repairs, with the help of on-screen annotations, in some cases enabling customer self-service. Enhancing hazard reporting and situational hazard management, by both improving the records a company keeps and being highly compatible with hands-free technologies like wearables. What challenges does the power and utilities sector face? Power and utilities is one of the most dynamic and complex sectors in the world. According to Deloitte, while the industry continues to grow, with electricity sales in the United States expanding by close to 4% between 2020 and 2021, things like unpredictable weather and the adoption of new technologies like flexible load programs are quickly transforming how providers do business, providing both opportunities and challenges. Operational resiliency in service delivery has never been as important for providers as it is right now. The keys to thriving in this constantly shifting environment include simplifying and automating workflows, connecting disparate data points, and providing real-time views anywhere in the world. For this article, the following definitions are used for the power and utilities sector: Electric utilities such as hydroelectric (water) power, fossil fuel power, and alternative energy sources like nuclear, wind, and solar. Gas utilities, which include natural gas distribution networks for natural gas retailing and commodity consumption. Water utilities that include production, transmission, and distribution of water for consumption, as well as the treatment of wastewater. Waterpower is considered separate, as mentioned above. Even from a bird\u2019s eye view, the challenges faced become evident. Power and utility providers increasingly need to collect accurate data and information from equipment without on-site travel, in part because of pandemic-related restrictions, as well as the need to service geographically remote locations. Regulation of the industry has become increasingly more stringent, with hefty fines for health and safety concerns as well as missed service level agreements (SLAs). Even in complex situations, both residential and commercial customers are looking for better and faster resolution times. Compounding these realities is an already shrinking workforce in utilities, with job growth currently receding by more than 7% over a 10-year period. The benefits of augmented reality in power and utilities In 2020, SightCall partnered with The Service Council to deliver a comprehensive report on the views and perspectives of field service technicians from a number of backgrounds. Technicians unanimously concurred that more technical knowledge was essential to their jobs today. And while about 70% also said customer and management demands had grown more intense, compounding pre-existing stresses, another 60% of respondents agreed that IT tools help to make their daily work easier. Incorporating an AR tool into service operations can make processes considerably more productive for both the provider and the customer. For example, technicians can use live video with AR capabilities to provide guided troubleshooting on the spot or conduct pre-visit assessments. First-time fix rates and overall resolution time can be significantly improved which have a direct result on enhanced customer satisfaction. Adoption of AR yields a number of specific operational improvements. Benefit #1: Create a more efficient pre-visit space. Utility workers can diagnose the severity of issues with pre-visit assessments to ensure the right people, parts and tools are dispatched to the field. Inspection times are shortened, and parts wastage and truck rolls avoided. Inspection times, waste and truck rolls are all reduced by triaging issues remotely via AR-powered live video. Benefit #2: Enable demos at the point of purchase. Power companies can bolster their sales departments in front of municipalities and private consumers alike, with remote product demos using immersive visual support to establish better understanding of a product or service. Benefit #3: Drive improvements in regulatory compliance and avoid fines. With an AR-powered digital platform, work order data can be seamlessly documented and recorded for internal QA, auditing and hazard reporting to flag dangers. Routine service inspections can be conducted consistently through remote experts, whatever external disruptions a company faces. Benefit #4: Transform the training experience. Newer technicians can be guided and shown different tasks on the job, with real-time visual assistance giving them an immersive training experience for the circumstances they will encounter in the real world. Indeed, some studies suggest that extended reality-based training such as through AR tools are particularly appropriate for riskier or more dangerous work environments where traditional training is less suitable. AR options are also highly flexible and can be accessed through real-time visual assistance or from a self-guided option, with the latter being an essential component of digital process automation. Why choose SightCall for power and utilities? The choice of SightCall, in particular, comes with a number of advantages and benefits. SightCall helps utility companies save on the three most expensive and indispensable assets they have: time, cost, and knowledge. Time: Think reduced outage times, fewer missed Service-Level Agreements (SLAs), and a decreased percentage of rework or duplicate dispatches to solve problems. Cost: By reducing truck rolls, avoiding regulatory fines, and experiencing less customer churn, SightCall helps drive significant cost savings for your business. Our platform decreases the likelihood of equipment-related accidents by transforming safety procedures to interactive, auditable experiences. Additionally, its use helps to cut down on CO 2 and other emission-related expenses by eliminating the time, cost, and carbon impact associated with wasted dispatches. Knowledge. SightCall\u2019s visual assistance platform allows your utility organization to retain workers and preserve their knowledge for the next generation. Our research suggests that enterprises have realized a 50% reduction in truck rolls, a 69% reduction in resolution time, an 81% increase in first-time fix rates, and a 41% reduction in training time after adopting SightCall within their remote assistance operations. Field service workers are not the only parties to experience benefits from remote visual assistance adoption. Additional utilities services like smart devices and solar panels, as well as customer self-service on more routine matters, are particularly amenable to digital process automation, which is explained below. AR and digital process automation An ideal partner to augmented reality, digital process automation harnesses technology to standardize workflows, improve performance and curtail errors that traditionally hinder essential business processes. It boosts the work of technicians and connections with customers. SightCall\u2019s own digital process automation solution, Digital Flows, raises service experiences to the next level by digitizing manual processes to improve efficiency and reduce manual error. Technician, agent, and customer procedures can all be delivered via a Digital Flow to guide self-service tasks in a repeatable, scalable, and auditable manner. Standardized, step-by-step guidance, including detailed instructions and checklists, help technicians and customers navigate tasks and work orders, without ambiguity or confusion. Participants in a Digital Flow also have the option to easily and rapidly escalate their inquiry to a person-to-person video assistance call if a higher level of support is required. Two of the use cases below explain how digital process automation can embolden power and utilities processes in the field. Can augmented reality create greater sustainability? As companies move toward net-zero emissions, AR and video assistance tools can help them collect data on their carbon footprint and savings. The U.S. power sector produced close to a third of overall energy emissions in 2020, according to Energy Information Administration estimates. And while the sector is well on the road to zero emissions, process efficiencies such as a reduced need for physical travel and the ability to closely assess internal energy usage and other sustainability calculations will remain essential. Augmented reality tools provided by the SightCall platform perform environmental footprint measurements at the end of every video call, using data points like travel distance and time saved, and average fuel consumption. Such precise KPIs can demonstrate the return on investment of not sending experts on-site, as well as demonstrate true action around sustainability. Examples of AR in power and utilities Case Study 1: Better digital integrations, reduced waste for water utility A water utility company grappled with slow response times, the increasing pressures of regulatory commitments, and hefty fines for violations discovered during audits. It sought to reduce water leaks and shorten resolution time for maintenance and repairs for its customers, with a digital solution that integrated closely with its Microsoft Dynamics 365 suite. With AR-powered visual assistance, customer service agents can now initiate a live visual assistance call directly from Dynamics 365, proactively diagnosing the problem in advance of resources being dispatched for an in-person site visit. The result is accelerated resolution times, improved data capture with seamless integration into the utility\u2019s existing system, and eliminating the time, cost and carbon impact of wasted dispatches. The company also observed reduced wastewater supplies, allowing it to better comply with industry and environmental regulations, and avoid fines. Case Study 2: Power company connects customers, technicians with rapid remote support Inspecting and even replacing electricity meters are core components of the work of power companies, with the highest levels of accuracy essential for correct monitoring and even billing information. This power utility faced several challenges, including technician scheduling challenges, the ability to access meters in-person because of travel restrictions during COVID-19, and requiring the latest technology for smart service of older equipment. Under its new, digitized system, a customer completes a self-guided Digital Flow, with forms and photos of their meter submitted before a technician arrives on site. The service technician, armed with these details, can quickly access the meter as soon as they arrive. When an issue is encountered that they are not trained for, the tech can access expert support with SightCall video assistance, completing the job in a single trip. The result is boosted customer satisfaction, as well as a reduction in additional trips to the site and other redundancies that act as a drag on enterprise productivity. Case Study 3: For complex wind turbines, issue resolution found in single site visit Another large power company with an extensive renewable energy branch needed a virtual assistance platform for inspecting and maintaining wind turbines that functioned despite spotty and inconsistent internet connections in some areas. With remote locales particularly vulnerable to limited data access, the augmented reality platform deployed by the utility needed to have the capacity to operate in low-bandwidth environments, as well as to save data and information to the technician\u2019s device for immediate upload to the file once connectivity was re-established. The company has options for its technicians, regardless of skill level, to use either a self-service option guided by a Digital Flow, or to escalate complex situations to a video call, both of which allow wind turbine inspections to be completed in a single visit. For self-service, online-capable workflows can retrieve error code definitions and photos to document issues for future training. Alternatively, an in-office expert can guide the technician to remedy more complex problems, with SightCall\u2019s globally distributed platform nodes that guarantee high performance and massive scalability wherever they are in the world. Supporting the rapid evolution of a major industry Power and utilities are rapidly evolving. Researchers at Gartner identified greater operational resiliency as one of the leading trends of the industry, and believe the latest technology will lead the way in realizing it. The ability to harness internal data more effectively will go a long way toward minimizing complexities, anticipating potential energy challenges and failures, and responding to the need to be more environmentally friendly. By enhancing the \u201ceyes\u201d a company has to view service landscapes and assess problems, augmented reality capabilities provide an essential boost to this work.

In fact, with free tools that have no integration to the CRM and FSM solutions used by enterprise organizations, there is no way to track ROI at all. In this blog, we examine some of the considerations involved in choosing a remote visual assistance solution, including the benefits of making the investment in a comprehensive, customized solution. What is remote visual assistance? Put simply, the definition of remote visual assistance is the use of digital tools to connect with customers, employees, or suppliers in the field, bringing remote experts directly to a problem or work order without the need for in-person travel. This can reduce barriers like location and time, as well as mitigate the impact of disruptions preventing physical trips to and from a job site. Visual assistance platforms are enhanced by technologies that add extra layers of context to what is captured by video. Artificial intelligence (AI), for instance, applies deep learning computer vision to assist field maintenance by identifying products, diagnosing the problem, and proposing solutions. Augmented reality (AR) puts an interactive, virtual component onto a real-world environment or situation, placing tools like informational text and 3D graphics atop a user\u2019s field of vision. The use of AR has grown exponentially over the last several years, with more than a billion global users projected in 2022 alone. Integrations are also key to visual assistance platforms, meaning that your remote support tools connect and embed within your CRM and FSM solutions like Microsoft Dynamics 365, Salesforce, SAP, Zendesk, Five9 and more. Through these integrations, service agents and technicians are able to provide seamless service from within their daily technical toolbox \u2013 rather than switching back and forth between disparate systems. Data that\u2019s collected is saved directly to case files. Integrations ensure better digital transformation for your team by encouraging widespread adoption and providing real ROI. The role of digital process automation Another way visual assistance integrates into business processes is through digital process automation. Digital process automation (DPA) harnesses technology to standardize workflows, improve performance and mitigate errors that traditionally hold essential functions back. SightCall\u2019s Digital Flows solution improves efficiency and reduces error. With the help of standardized, step-by-step guidance, including detailed instructions and checklists, technicians and service workers can complete tasks with no ambiguity or confusion. In a number of ways, digital process automation can expedite issue resolution, contributing to higher first-time fix rates for companies, one of the most difficult key performance indicators to address. For example, technicians can reduce average handling time by collecting essential information from the customer prior to the start of a virtual session or in-person dispatch. Site visits can be made more successful by guaranteeing that the correct parts, tools, and technicians with certain skills are sent. And with DPA, experts can validate and test customers\u2019 devices prior to conducting a visual assistance call, to determine whether or not the phone or tablet will be an optimal channel for communication. With an easier way to receive guidance in the field, a number of work orders that would have otherwise failed are successful, ensuring a drastic reduction in the number of unnecessary on-site visits. Technicians have immediate access to remote experts and can receive live, AR-powered assistance to help them resolve complex tasks from any mobile device or wearable. New technicians are also more effective in the field, with our data showing a 41% decrease in training time post-digitization. Complexity is removed from traditionally onerous activities with a high risk of costly error, like manual data entry. This means skilled technicians can handle more jobs remotely and work at their maximum potential, regardless of their level of experience or expertise. The company can then more effectively collect, share and deliver service knowledge across the organization. Such information can be subsequently stored and used for employee training, as well as quality assurance, mitigating the challenges caused by company experts retiring or leaving. What are some strengths of free remote support tools? If a company chooses to use a tool like WhatsApp, FaceTime, or Zoom in a business setting, they are looking for the most basic functions of face-to-face digital communication. The standard versions of both do not cost companies anything to download and are ubiquitous in most regions of the world. Apps like these are also used in everyday life outside of business. As such, companies may feel as though they will have an easier time persuading customers to digitally connect with them through a familiar platform. What are the drawbacks of free remote support apps? Companies that try to use these apps over the long term may encounter issues such as: Privacy concerns and spyware scares, making the use of these apps particularly unsuitable for industries in which data protection rules are strict. For instance, WhatsApp is not compliant with the EU\u2019s GDPR regulations or HIPPA. Possible access issues if more than one team member needs to engage with a customer or answer a question through the platforms. Lack of integration within existing customer relationship management (CRM) tools and FSM (field search management) tools. Limited automation options, making the tool hard to scale. Even simple automation, like chatbots, is not possible through these apps. Not necessarily device-agnostic, and dependent on the ability to connect to the internet, 3G, 4G, or LTE data at all times. Some platforms also take up too much space on the user\u2019s device. No business plans, customer success teams, or service agreements are available to ensure continuity of service in a work environment These drawbacks mean that companies can find their room for maneuver constrained when it comes to using free tools for remote visual support. In particular, they may experience difficulty or impossibility scaling the tool for standardized use in their operations. The benefits of SightCall\u2019s remote visual assistance platform The SightCall platform is distinct in being optimized for visual support use cases. This means that it has the advanced engineering necessary for successful AR-powered video assistance calls, without requiring users to make trade-offs in situations where bandwidth or connectivity is a challenge. For instance, many inexpensive tools and applications will prioritize a particular call capability like audio, meaning that if a bandwidth challenge occurs, the app will drop the video. It may also drastically reduce the frame rate within the video, allowing for at least some data to pass through, but not at the quality level of a face-to-face conversation. Because SightCall has been built from the ground up, our tool not only has the ability to offer the best of both worlds in audio and video quality, regardless of geographical challenges or conditions like bandwidth, we also have the ability to make continual, detailed technical modifications to the platform to support customer use cases. The platform can also tailor user experiences through configuration, tailored to the type of troubleshooting that each use case needs. Lastly, to maximize privacy and data protection, SightCall can be used in an end-to-end encryption manner, well beyond what would be offered on a standard communication platform. When used together as with SightCall, there are a number of benefits of remote visual assistance, powered by both AI and AR, including: The ability to perform actions on mobile devices and instantly receive relevant information with enriched real-world objects. The use of devices to record measurements that can be sent directly to a customer relationship management (CRM) system, FSM (field search management) system or case file. Dropping digital AR tools onto objects in the real world to show workers or technicians how to perform tasks. Being guided in the field by a remote expert, even through complex repairs, with the help of on-screen annotations. Information is neither captured nor kept on an app like WhatsApp, but by comparison, SightCall visual assistance platform records it. In the sections that follow are a few case studies that provide a useful comparison and contrast. GE Healthcare Example Challenge: GE Healthcare, a global health technology company, specializes in the engineering and production of diagnostic machinery \u2013 including MRI, CT and X-ray scanners. When troubleshooting an issue during a field maintenance visit was especially complicated, a field technician mobilized one of their peers or a more senior technician to the job site, resulting in multiple trips and increased labor costs applied to a work order. This often caused the affected machinery to be out of use for a period of time while a solution was found. Even a day without an MRI scanner creates a significant functional barrier for clinics. Patient appointments are delayed or canceled, and the scanner becomes unavailable in the event an emergency arises. GE\u2019s goal was to shorten time on site and improve first-time fix rates. Resolution: With SightCall AR-powered visual assistance, field technicians were impressed by the reliable video quality and consistent audio and video. They could carry out remote-guided repairs with greater ease and agility, thanks to touchless capabilities using the device of their choice. Site data, such as product serial numbers, could be fed back to the work order through the OCR tool, with the smartphone camera simply held in front of the desired data to read it, with no manual entry required. Outcomes: Maintenance turnaround times were shortened to averages of six to eight hours, versus three days prior to the implementation of SightCall. With the average call taking only 40 minutes, the company estimates it has saved hundreds of thousands of dollars in travel costs. Kraft Heinz Example Challenge: Safe food practices impact consumers all over the world and are crucial for human health. Despite COVID-19, Kraft Heinz needed to continue the high standards of food safety for consumers, without disrupting a supply chain built on a wide network of suppliers, co-packers, and warehouses. The company required a remote virtual support system robust enough to be implemented in a variety of specific use cases, and allow for the standardization of both routine and incident-related audits. Resolution: Deploying SightCall visual assistance, Kraft Heinz leverages SightCall for every step of its visits to/with partners, including suppliers, co-packers, factories, and warehouses. Before inspections begin, video calls are used to share relevant documents and arrange logistics. During the inspection, expert remote auditors deploy features like flashlight control to get better visibility in dim light, and AR annotations to illustrate recommendations or identify potential issues. With the ability to capture and save photos from live video, they can store visual records of equipment and processes alongside the inspection or audit documents. Outcomes: Before using video, live visits such as factory tours and inspections could take up to three days to complete, sometimes resulting in multiple visits. This was due to the need to review relevant documents and certifications while on-site \u2013 something that can now be done through virtual inspections in advance. With less travel, simple coordination, quicker resolution times, and the ease of storing documentation, the number of inspections and audits conducted has skyrocketed \u2013 with the added benefit for a socially conscious company with a lower carbon footprint. The benefits of investing in digitization Visual assistance platforms like SightCall provide greater technological capabilities, business system integrations, and reductions in human error \u2013 bringing enterprises a tangible ROI. Within months, the platform can prove its own value in reduced truck rolls, improved customer satisfaction, reduced carbon footprint, reduced human error, and more. Free tools that do not complement, or integrate within, existing systems will often lead businesses to deploy multiple visual assistance solutions that operate in silos, producing even greater inefficiencies. It can often help managers to make a final decision by seeing each of the products in action.

New technologies are leading the way in helping them do so. Service organizations are usually at the top of the list of quick-win business units when it comes to boosting environmental impact. Within each of them are opportunities to cut down on physical travel, reduce or eliminate parts wastage, and avoid product returns from their customers. These efficiencies and savings are a benefit for the planet, as well as for a company\u2019s bottom line. Problematically, however, is that most organizations lack the ability to accurately quantify and report their ESG metric improvements. A 2021 report from Deloitte names several essential considerations for optimizing ESG in practice: How do companies get complete, reliable data? Once they have it, how do they operationalize and work with the data? How is the data reported? And what does it tell the company about its operations? Visual assistance is highly beneficial for companies looking to implement meaningful and quantifiable answers to these challenges, helping field service organizations to reduce their impact on the environment. Then they can see, assess, and harness their ESG data to both accelerate corporate responsibility measures and bolster regulatory compliance. What SightCall can do for sustainability SightCall is proud to be a sustainability solution for enterprises, and we\u2019re particularly excited to invite everyone to sign up and join us at our Quantifying Sustainability webinar on Thursday, April 21, 2022, at 10:00 am CDT. During this session, you\u2019ll discover how your business can use visual assistance technology to elevate sustainability efforts and quantify the impact on our planet, in order to meet your corporate sustainability objectives. Additionally, for each verified webinar registration, SightCall will plant one tree in the registrant\u2019s name through our partners at One Tree Planted. With our new Sustainability Dashboard, you can now record and share your ESG metrics, derived from the usage of our visual assistance platform, to gain a greater understanding of your impact on the environment. On the compliance side, this has the added benefit of aligning with ESG reporting standards set by the government. Our guest speaker, Allianz\u2019s Albert Miralles, will talk about the positive impact visual assistance technology has had on the business in significantly reducing carbon emissions. Allianz can now accurately track and measure CO2 savings for each avoided on-site visit to a policyholder\u2019s home through SightCall\u2019s new Sustainability Dashboard. There is continued pressure from governments mandating adherence to regulations, as well as investor and consumer expectations to measure and report on sustainability metrics. For all this, our solutions are here to help. We\u2019re empowering our customers across manufacturing, retail, utilities, healthcare, and insurance to reduce their CO2 emissions using SightCall\u2019s remote visual support technology.

FS software from companies including ServiceMax, ClickSoftware, ServicePower, and others have done a great job replacing paper and Excel spreadsheets with very effective cloud-based software solutions. The next wave of FS digital transformation has arrived with IoT and Augmented Reality, highlighting both self-diagnostics and human intervention. Everyone can acknowledge that human intervention will remain important during upcoming decades; so the question which remains, is how can we empower experts and technicians to be more efficient in the variety of their tasks, in an always more connected, technological, and complex environment? Step one: Augmenting sight on site The first step of the transformation is to provide the ability to physically view a technical problem remotely. In 2015, half of the companies who participated in a survey considered the ability to show what the technician sees as the most likely help available to improve efficiency. Empowering centralized expertise with the ability to see what the technician sees is just AWESOME! We can assume that the reason why \u201conly\u201d half of the participating companies in this survey answered that they were considering the adoption of these capabilities is due to the nascent nature of the market. They were not yet exposed to reliable, efficient and easy to use solutions. No one would argue that seeing a problem or situation rather than just having a discussion about it clearly is more efficient in most circumstances. Unfortunately, video conferencing companies such as Vidyo or BlueJeans are creating confusion by attempting to force fit their unsuitable conferencing services towards addressing remote expertise. Companies pursuing this path discover that such tools are cumbersome and add limited value to solving problems and hence their adoption is poor. Trust me, your field force is not motivated enough to connect to a video conference bridge. SightCall has taken a very different approach by providing an integrated solution which is more readily adapted to the field service workflow. Just as Salesforce Service Cloud and RightNow (known today as Oracle Service Cloud) are empowering customer service agents by giving them access to an extensive CRM, SightCall is empowering centralized experts to support the field force. Knowing that in the field there is plenty of expertise shared between field technicians (this is often referred to as tribal knowledge), SightCall further enables this sharing from one tech to another using their smartphones with a single touch. Step two: Augmenting reality Although seeing the problem does help a great deal, it is not enough. The field workforce is motivated by one thing: getting the job done. One of our customers mentioned that with SightCall Visual Support, he was transforming their customer service \u201cfrom a complaints department into a solutions department\u201d. He also stated that one of the major benefits, along with increasing their customer satisfaction through solving their customers\u2019 problems, was reducing the churn in the contact center. People naturally enjoy being able to help others and finish the job right. This drive is essential within the customer and field service industries! So, how do we empower experts to help solve problems remotely? By using a combination of tools; repairs often require not one tool but multiples. Remote drawing, document sharing, co-browsing, live pointers, and many other useful features make guidance more efficient, \u201cas if we were together.\u201d Now let\u2019s take one additional step and see how problem solving can be even more efficient remotely than if we were together by leveraging the advantages of being connected. SightCall is bringing the expert an integrated experience from the company\u2019s software ecosystem and knowledge base. While integrated, the interaction can be enriched. Experts and technicians can leverage helpful information on their screen, augmenting their reality with artificial intelligence. Our friends at the service council have continued to collect data from large customers leveraging video assistance, including SightCall customers, decided to perform a market study on Adding Augmented Reality to Field Service Software. Most of the current identified business cases are focused on improving First Time Fix and reducing time to resolution. You can find the Service Council AR webinar here: In addition to the Augmented Reality benefits identified by this study (First Time Fix ratio improvement while incomplete visit rate decreases), SightCall customers also reported other interesting facts: Parts management: Video assisted pre-visits drastically increases First Time Resolution ratio Time spent on site: Getting the right advice at the time they need it on the field, helps technicians to complete their work faster Resource & skills management: Knowing that technicians can be helped remotely provides more flexibility in resource management. Furthermore, by being guided, field technicians learn and increase their skills even without traditional training. Augmented Reality combined with Artificial Intelligence offer limitless opportunities to improve efficiencies in the Field Service industry. Today, in 2017, devices should no longer be considered to limit the acceleration of these combined technologies. It is a few years since our attempted Google Glass integration and analysis that the Google technology was a miserable failure suffering a combination of poor battery life and overheating problems. Although we are always happy to integrate and be part of the many new \u201cthings\u201d being introduced, at this time we continue to believe that the trusted smartphone is at the center of this transformation. Our recommendation: The Field Service transformation is being embraced by the industry. Visual Support is already broadly deployed globally. Augmented Reality empowered with Artificial Intelligence is already drastically changing the way field forces are working together. The path to implement this transformation of your software ecosystem and data requires interoperability with Augmented Video Assistance. The great news is that the combined technologies are available today, in 2017. Our recommended approach is a graduated step by step process in which seeing, guiding and augmenting become part of your business process.

In many cases, home damage appraisals can be handled remotely via an app on the customer\u2019s smartphone or tablet. And, this makes it possible to process a claim in just a few days. After the successful completion of the trial, the deployment contract with SightCall has just been signed. A crucial step The rapid and accurate settlement of claims is the core business of all insurers. At this \u201cmoment of truth\u201d the expertise \u2013 the phase during which a company expert visits the site to assess the extent of the damage and assign the compensation due \u2013is a crucial step that strongly influences processing times and customer satisfaction. From now on, in many cases which involve damage to a dwelling (following a fire, storm, water damage, etc.), AG Insurance can apply the \u201cvideo-expertise\u201d technique. The expert no longer needs to visit the site and can get in contact with the client via an app installed on their smartphone or tablet. The camera of their mobile device enables the expert to visualize and estimate the damage. The app offers the expert the ability to make a photo or video recordings and control the flash in darker spaces (e.g., a cellar). By integrating this technique of \u201cvideo-expertise\u201d into a highly simplified workflow, the duration of claims processing is drastically reduced, going from 3 to 4 weeks on average to only a few days. 90% of claims settled the same day The test period demonstrated that a video expertise takes an average of 20 minutes. By reducing the duration of the intervention and removing travel, it becomes easier to coordinate the calendars of the expert and the client and to schedule an appointment more quickly. Another time-saver: the customer no longer has to ask for a quote from a repairman, a formality that requires on average almost 3 weeks. Indeed, the experience of the expert and a calculation tool developed by AG Insurance (with a database containing the most current prices in the construction sector) makes it possible in most cases to immediately calculate the appropriate compensation. If the client agrees, the expert can then close the file and pay the compensation to the customer\u2019s account on the same day. The test phase demonstrated that this was the case in about 90% of all video expertises. The video expertise applies to all clients, whether they are insured at AG Insurance via BNP Paribas Fortis or through a broker. In the latter case, it goes without saying that the broker can also be involved in the video-expertise process. If he wishes, he can attend the remote appraisal via the same app. AG Insurance estimates that only 20% of all claims that require expertise can\u2019t be settled by video expertise. Edwin Klaps, Administrator \u2013 Non-life & Brokerage Channel Director: \u201cWhether they are mild or more serious, damage to your home is always a source of concern. Customers want repairs to take place as quickly as possible. Thanks to video expertise, we can ensure a much faster, more transparent, and user-friendly treatment for the client. One of our goals is to increase customer satisfaction. The test phase showed us that this objective is clearly achieved and that both the client and the broker and AG Insurance take advantage of this new process. The video-expertise illustrates perfectly how the introduction of digital techniques in the treatment of claims can exert a positive influence on the client experience.\u201d Thomas Cottereau \u2013 CEO SightCall: SightCall is the leader in video assistance solutions and actively participates in the digital transformation of companies around the world, especially insurers. We are particularly pleased to participate in the transformation of the interactions between AG Insurance and its customers by enabling them to benefit from immediate expertise and optimized damage resolution. During the test phase, AG Insurance has paid particular attention to the subjects of the customer experience, the optimization of the claims processing chain, and the position of the broker. The result is a very fine digital transformation that benefits all the players involved in claims management.

No matter how big or small, accidents and disasters can be a scary and exhausting time, and you want to get life back to normal as quickly as possible. With SightCall Visual Claims, insurance companies can now provide the immediacy and ease of use that customers demand, while improving claim accuracy and reducing costs! Matt has a small accident with his car, he calls his insurance to get started with the claims process. Because Matt is still in the moment and location of the accident, the insurance company can expedite the claims process, and life can start getting back to normal again for Matt. How? By providing the initial assessment (aka FNOL \u2013 first notification of loss) remotely Matt speaks to his adjuster, Sara, who, instead of setting up an appointment, starts a video call with the back camera of Matt\u2019s mobile phone. Tools such as flashlight control, pausing live video, annotations, and picture sharing help Matt and Sara discuss the damage in the same context and eliminates the risk of inaccurate claims. Once Matt moves closer to the damage areas Sara turns on the flashlight and pauses the video. Sara can then draw on the image to highlight the damaged parts and then save the image to the claim. The claim is filed within minutes following the accident! B y speeding-up the supplemental claim process After the FNOL process, the damage vehicle is transported to an identified repair shop. Almost every time, the repair shop requires additional work to your car. And before they start anything they need approval from your insurance company. Using SightCall Visual Claims, the insurance company communicates with the repair shop to validate the supplemental claim that represents an accurate and complete estimate to repair the vehicle as the value for the loss. What are the main advantages? 1. Improved Accuracy Not having an agent physically inspect claims might make some insurers uneasy but Insurance companies can\u2019t send an adjuster all the time and they sometimes have to rely on documents that can actually be \u201cdoctored\u201d or \u201cfaked\u201d using readily available tools. Live video, picture sharing and geo-location features provided by SightCall Visual Claims actually reduce the risk of inaccurate claims. 2. Reduced costs Reduce cost associated with sending an adjuster to multiple locations. Adjusters are spending less time traveling and more time talking to customers. 3. Increased customer satisfaction The sooner your customers can get their claim filed, the sooner they can get their lives back in order. And, the faster that happens, the happier they are with their insurance company, boosting customer satisfaction and loyalty.

How Much is Poor Customer Service Costing You? SightCall Can you think back to when you had a bad customer experience? Did something to come to mind immediately? Memories are tied to emotions, and we tend to recall both really negative and really positive experiences, because they are tied to angry and happy emotions, respectively. It takes twelve positive experiences to make up for one negative experience. Yes, twelve. Customer service requires companies to be proactive versus reactive. A company should constantly hold itself to certain standards and should continue to improve its current customer service. Because of this customer service affects your bottom line. According to the infographic below, it is seven times more expensive to acquire a new customer than to keep a new one. In today\u2019s competitive landscape and availability of mass information, it\u2019s easy for customers to find other alternatives to your product or service, and usually, those alternatives are your direct competitors. In fact, 89% of customers who had a poor experience make their next purchase from a competitor according to Harris Interactive. You are basically shooting yourself in the foot when you provide bad customer experiences, which leads to revenue loss, spending more capital trying to get those customers to return and giving away your revenue to competitors. On a grander scale, U.S. businesses lose an estimated $83 billion annually due to poor experience. See all of the costs associated with bad customer service in the infographic below. Fortunately, there are many businesses that offer solutions to any customer service-related problem ranging from general solutions to niche unique solutions. You have companies like Zendesk and Salesforce providing platforms to make the customer experience seamless and easy, ultimately raising the standard for Customer Service. Customer service comes down to two fundamentals: accessibility to support and solving an issue in a timely manner. Instead of being reactive to poor customer service provided by your company, you can be proactive and make sure you have the necessary tools to provide a positive experience. You can spend a small fraction of the cost of losing a customer to offer the necessary tools to provide a positive experience. Offering quick and easy methods for a customer to reach you are easier in theory than in practice. Luckily there are solutions that you can integrate into your companies\u2019 customer service process. If you are looking to offer live chat on your website, companies like Zopim and Olark are available. Here at SightCall, we provide a real-time, live video solution that can be implemented into your current customer service process to see what your customers see. With these types of solutions implemented into your customer service process, your customers are bound to have a positive experience.

Luckily as a customer support agent on the other end of that call there are a few things to practice when dealing with angry customers. Below is a list that will help deal with angry customers: It\u2019s never personal Most of the time, customers dread contacting customer support so when it finally does happen there\u2019s a good chance that the customer wants to get off the phone as fast as you do. Customers will usually get straight to the point, raise their voice, disregard proper etiquette when it comes to language and throw everything at you but the kitchen sink. But it\u2019s ok. They aren\u2019t actually mad at you. They are disappointed/mad about the service or product that your company provides. Don\u2019t argue back Getting into a verbal shouting contest with an angry customer is both ineffective and inefficient \u2013 meaning that it gets you nowhere. Instead of arguing back, kill them with kindness. Sorry for being so clich\u00e9 but there is a reason why we still value the life of one Mahatma Gandhi. Patience is a virtue When anyone dials customer support they just want to vent. The psychological aspect comes into play big time. Think of the situation from the shoes of the customer for a second. The scenarios are endless but let\u2019s go with this example. Jane just bought a pair of rain boots from your online store. She\u2019s already kicking herself over the fact that she missed the final day of your online sale because she had a family emergency to tend to. Now she buys the boots full price. She doesn\u2019t mind that much since the boots are really cute and she knows that she\u2019ll need them since winter is coming. Although she\u2019s never purchased from your online store before, your company website prides itself in free two-day shipping which is another incentive for her to purchase. She decides to order the boots. Unfortunately for Jane her new boots don\u2019t arrive in two days like the website said they would. And what makes it even worse, a week later the local weatherman was wrong about the storm they were tracking. It arrives tomorrow morning and Jane still doesn\u2019t have her boots. Jane is thrilled when the boots finally do arrive. She finally wears them out but within the first two hours the rubber soles start deteriorating and she has to go back home to change boots which makes her late for a job interview that she had prepared two weeks for. Like I said, the scenarios are endless and the story of Jane and her rain boots could had gone on forever. The bottom line is that when we interact with other people we don\u2019t know, we have no clue to what is going on in their life. Having patience with others is probably the least we could do. Apologize the right way One of the most annoying things any customer service agent can do when on the phone, video call or chat session with a customer is to use a generic, insincere apology. There is definitely a right way and a wrong way to sympathize/empathize with a customer and seeming like you are just reading off a script or copy and pasting text into a chat window is the wrong way. Here are some good ways to apologize the right way: After you apologize tell the customer that you are going to work together to solve their problem. Tell the customer that they are right. It\u2019s a crazy concept, I know. You can do this by agreeing with them. Once the mutual understanding is there, customers become more flexible when coming to a solution. Ask the customer what they want \u2013 what will make them happy? Sometimes it\u2019s better to hedge your bet on the lifetime value of a customer then lose a customer for life over a pair of $50 jeans. Let the customer provide the solution Before a customer calls support they\u2019ve probably run the situation through their head a thousand times. They know what they want and they usually have a solution ready for action. So, as a customer service agent, use this solution to your advantage. It might actually make sense for your perspective, defuse the situation entirely and build customer loyalty all at the same time. Relieve your stress I worked in a call center as an inside sales representative right out of college. It\u2019s not the same as customer support but the atmosphere and the stress levels are identical. Relieving stress after hundreds of \u201cno\u201d answers or after a frustrating customer support call is essential to human sanity. Here are some things you can do to relieve stress after a tough customer support call: Get up. Go outside for a walk and take in the fresh air and scenery. Go bother that coworker that tells you stories and makes you laugh. Eat something healthy. Drew Carey and I share the same opinion that eating crappy food isn\u2019t a reward \u2013 it\u2019s a punishment. Working long hours in a contact center, taking hundreds of customer service calls a week is a demanding job for anybody. But if you follow the simple steps above, your days will go by a lot faster and you might even have a better experience when dealing with angry customers.

It\u2019s bad enough that we have to put everything else aside and be on standby for a six hour period. But what\u2019s worse is when that 30 minute service call turns into an hour or an hour and a half because the cable guy gets confused, has the wrong parts or simply isn\u2019t prepared for the job. Nobody wants to wait longer then they have to. Customer service statistics say that 82% of U.S. consumers said they stopped doing business with a company due to a poor customer service experience. Now, whether you install cable in homes or service industrial machines in factories, it\u2019s obvious that field service technicians need to be able to solve problems and get things done faster than ever before to ensure a high level customer experience. Currently, the smartphone or handheld is the primary communication tools for 49% of a company\u2019s field service workforce (other devices include rugged and non-rugged laptops and tablets). This trend is only growing. It is also estimated that by 2018, 70% of mobile workers will use a tablet or some sort of hybrid device that has tablet-like characteristics. What does this mean for field service? The simple answer is that field service management software demand will explode. The unclear answer is how field service management software companies will differentiate themselves from the market by providing unique solutions and experiences. There are a lot of field service management software companies out there. Most them offer an easy-to-use interface/dashboard that displays scheduled work orders, parts information, account information, SLA clocks etc. Even some field service management software companies have social forums and communities embedded into the interface. These social solutions allow field service technicians the ability to access an internal network of real time collaboration with other agents for better, faster and easier troubleshooting. Social collaboration, according to ServiceMax which is a leading field service management software company, isn\u2019t about being trendy or \u201csocial\u201d at all. It ensures that an entire team is behind each technician you send to a customer site. Because of their social collaboration platform, ServiceMax reports that the average user increases first-time fix rates by 18% and decreases mean time to repair by 19%. Although social collaboration features in field service management software seem useful but, like other enterprise social platforms, are extremely difficult to adopt internally and get workers to actively participate. But what else could be done to streamline the field service process, get the job done faster and work more efficiently to ensure a positive customer experience? One innovative way to boost productivity and overall quality during service calls is for the field service technician to be able to communicate, in context, with other experts in real-time to solve problems faster. Real-time video calling, embedded right into the field service management software, gives technicians instant access to immediate answers and resources. But it can go way further than a simple video call. Collaboration tools integrated within the video call is the next step. Being able to take and upload a picture, or draw and annotate right on the screen during the video call can provide clarity to the underlying discussion which, in turn, solves problem faster and reduces the overall service call time. Recording can also be a very valuable asset to the company. Being able to record and store videos for future reference can be used for training purposes which indirectly results in reduced service time the next go around. Below is a video that helps visually show you the power behind video calling collaboration features within field service management software applications. When it comes to field service, customers have two goals for the technician. First, get the job done right and second, get the job done quickly. Statistics say that 81% of companies with strong capabilities and competencies for delivering customer experience excellence are outperforming their competitors. Adding video calling collaboration tools to field service management software achieves both of these goals.

He tries to describe the situation as best he can, but is having difficulty explaining everything that is going on. In order to confirm his details, your agent will have to schedule a time for a claims adjuster to visit his house to get some of the finer details, corroborate his story, and approve the claim. As the agent checks the availability of the next adjuster, two weeks from now, she thinks to herself, \u201cimagine if I could just see everything from his point of view right now.\u201d She makes a good point. What if your agents could verify claim information in real-time without the need to spend time and money sending an adjuster to the location? The technology is here. While an agent is talking to a customer, they can gather crucial information from him or her. But, there is only so much that a voice-based call can offer. If agents deem that claims can be filed on the spot they can leverage customers who are already on location by starting a video call. Nearly 2 out of every 3 adults in the US now own a smartphone, up 35% from 2011 and not showing signs of slowing down. You can leverage the power of this continuously growing segment of the population. Avoid sending an adjuster on-site when it\u2019s not necessary and instead have the customer show your agents the damage via video calling. Not only does this reduce the cost associated with sending an adjuster to multiple locations, it means that adjusters are spending less time traveling and more time talking to customers. This decreases wait time for customers who need to file quickly. The sooner your customers can get their claim filed, the sooner they can get their lives back in order. And, the faster that happens, the happier they are with their insurance company, boosting customer satisfaction and loyalty. Fighting fraud is another ongoing battle for insurance companies. Not having an agent physically inspect claims might make some insurers uneasy. However, with a built-in geo-location feature, you can be assured that the location matches the claim information. With live video and recording capabilities, your agents can direct the customer to show you anything that seems out of order. And, from the customers\u2019 perspective, they can share any images from a smartphone\u2019s camera roll to show the situation at any time prior to the damage and share it directly with agents. By seeing problems in real-time, you can help customers file claims properly which will reduce time waiting for approval instead of re-filing a claim that had errors. Agents can also show customers how to handle the situation so that it is completed faster and further damage is prevented. This helps reduce repair time, which can save money on claims such as water damage, where the damage can get worse the longer it goes without being addressed, with complications with mildew, mold, or rotting wood. Now everything is more efficient. Once your agents or adjusters have seen the problem the final step is to actually file the claim. Agents can push pre-filled claims documents directly to the customer\u2019s device. All the customer needs to do is verify the information is correct and sign on the dotted line. Now, with SightCall Visual Claims, the agent is able to see the problem in real-time, confirm that it is legitimate, add images to the claim, and have a customer file directly from his smartphone. The claims process that was going to take two weeks was instead reduced to a matter of minutes. If you\u2019re ready to get started, talk to us about trying a SightCall Visual Claims demo today or check out a short video about how to file insurance claims in real-time.

Consistently in person, that is. Flash forward to 2020. Many medical technology companies turned to digital tools to connect virtually as they navigated physical distancing rules. It was an immediate hit. Consider that 47% of doctors who preferred in-person visits before COVID-19 now prefer virtual support or fewer in-person interactions. Now, Medtech organizations are looking to the future. As they build on learnings from the past year, they are figuring out the right balance of virtual and in-person engagements in a hybrid world. Helping patients make the most of their home-based respiratory equipment Apria Healthcare provides home-based oxygen therapy and other respiratory services to more than two million patients. Early in the pandemic, many of the company\u2019s respiratory therapists weren\u2019t able to visit patients in-person to help them learn and use their equipment. Apria needed a new virtual technology solution that was easy for everyone to use \u2014 employees and patients alike \u2014 and didn\u2019t require users to download an app or log in to a new website. \u201cWe wanted to make sure that our Apria users initiate the call and video by using email or text. That was the one key requirement.\u201d \u2013 Manisha Naik Senior IT Director, Apria Apria found a virtual option that was simple for anyone to use by partnering with SightCall, an enterprise-grade video cloud platform that integrates with Salesforce. \u201cWe are very happy with the integration \u2026 Our patients are taking our calls and they\u2019re using our tool. [Our technicians] are able to solve their issues \u2026 without visiting the patient at home.\u201d \u2013 Manisha Naik Senior IT Director, Apria The out-of-the-box, cloud solution allowed them to hit the ground running in a matter of weeks. And with an intuitive interface and easy-to-understand workflow, Apria\u2019s respiratory technicians quickly got the hang of the new system. They started helping patients operate and troubleshoot their continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machines and get readings on non-invasive ventilation (NIV) machines through video calls. One of Apria\u2019s respiratory therapists explained that the new system helped them to build trust virtually without an in-home interaction. It also revolutionized the company\u2019s customer experience. Consider the case of one Apria customer who called in asking to return his CPAP machine because he couldn\u2019t figure out how to use it. The agent suggested a video call and after just 10 minutes, the patient felt confident using the machine that night and ultimately kept the product. Take the next step for your virtual sales transformation Medtech companies that have oriented themselves around a virtual customer experience have innovated faster during this time ensuring patients get full value from their medical device. As many medical device sales and service reps return to work, delivering a connected virtual selling and support experience is even more important to master. Are you prepared to give customers what they want from anywhere? If not, it could be the right time to consider how you will sell and service virtually now and in the future.

Statistics compiled by the Population Reference Bureau suggest the number of Americans 65 and older will almost double from just over 50 million people to 95 million by the year 2060. In 2018, about 24% of men and 16% of women over the age of 65 were active participants in the labor force, figures which, pre-pandemic, were projected to rise to 26% and 18%, respectively, in 2026. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics concurs that older workers\u2019 share of the workforce will grow, having previously projected an expansion of more than 4% for workers 65 to 74 by 2024 and more than 6% for workers 75 and older. These are modest gains \u2014 but not enough to stop a looming crisis. Especially in the field service industry, older professionals have started to leave their roles in large numbers. Numerous enterprises have expressed concern about both knowledge loss related to the retiring workforce and an insufficient pool of incoming workers. A gap has opened between the two, growing wider as existing workers retire and new graduates avoid service or technical careers. Enterprises that have integrated technology into their everyday operations will, without question, be better prepared for this uncertain future than those that have not. They can hold on to the knowledge assets of experienced professionals while attracting and retaining bright, new talent who can apply valuable skills to critical field service operations. Narrowing Skills Gaps In Future Hires One U.K. survey found that half of large employers reported difficulty recruiting the right people for open roles, with technicians being the fourth hardest type of position to fill. And while scores of prospective employees have a number of transferable skills, adapting these to the needs of a job is generally time-consuming and expensive. Consider the example of visual support as a potential solution. The immersive capabilities of such tools as augmented reality (AR) and the insights provided by artificial intelligence (AI) can prepare the next generation of labor while also driving crucial operational improvements. Visual support nurtures more effective and personalized learning. Overlaying interactive virtual objects and data onto a real-world scenario, a new technician can be guided through maintenance, repair and troubleshooting tasks at their own pace. In theory, the learning curve can be adjusted from person to person, meeting each trainee where they are in their skill development journey. However, such technologies are only as useful as the algorithms they are fed. To boot, there are some things that \u2014 at least for now \u2014 digital solutions can\u2019t be taught, including understanding conversational nuance and meaningfully empathizing with human feelings. This can limit the training experience, particularly for customer-facing functions. Data-Driven Technologies To Improve Retention Another problem faced by enterprises in a number of industries, from restaurants and hotels to long-term care, is workers absorbing crucial skills that they then take and apply elsewhere. Retention issues are another facet of the workforce crisis, one that will need to be handled, especially as new positions created by retiring workers become harder to fill. Figuring out what draws their best talent away will involve companies mapping the worker experience from start to finish and identifying the pain points of their day-to-day experiences on the job. What, for example, is the most tedious or inefficient aspect of their role? Can handing that aspect over to an automated process make workers feel freer to focus on more creative tasks? To get here, adopting (or improving) cloud-based data software is an essential place to start. Not only does strong, readily accessible data help rapidly identify pain points, but it can even help with decisions about the technologies that could best resolve a problem situation for workers. Just be aware that there will be unequal outcomes between companies that implement cloud data. Time and resource constraints mean many enterprises won\u2019t be able to continuously change their processes in response to the newly acquired data. Boosting The Bottom Line Drives More Sustainable, Adaptable Companies Still, as workers of all ages are more determined than ever before to find meaningful and sustainable roles, making their operations more efficient by incorporating technology can strengthen an enterprise\u2019s foundation. As companies adjust to a much different looking workforce, there\u2019s ample opportunity to increase preparedness for the future. A more widespread embrace of digital tools will go a long way to turn these changes from crisis mode to a natural \u2014 and even welcome \u2014 evolution in how people work.

While efficiency is improved for all claims, the tool is extremely invaluable for helping clients who have suffered major losses because of natural disasters. Catastrophic natural events continue to increase in frequency and severity, turning homeowners\u2019 lives upside-down before, during, and after the event. Insurers struggle to manage a large influx of claims with limited resources and frustrated policyholders. Using the Remote Inspection Tool can help save field adjusting resources for more complex losses where their skills are truly needed, saving insurers time and money. Remote Claims with Added Features During the claims process, the policyholder installs the easy-to-use app to record damage via video or photos right on the spot. The inspector can see and verify the damage instantly through a SightCall session. A remote agent can guide the policyholder via live video feed and record all damages. The Remote Inspection tool also merges up-to-date aerial imagery to see the property from a birds-eye view, also allowing the adjuster to take measurements from these photos. Capturing the GPS coordinates during the call can verify the location of the policyholder and the claim. The Remote Inspection tool produces custom reports instantly including all documentation, photos, and videos from the SightCall session. Remote agents can access the reports through a custom dashboard. The policyholder can receive confirmation of inspection in minutes after a summary report of the video call is sent to the adjuster. These comprehensive reports expedite the underwriting inspection process by reducing the need for a third-party to conduct the inspection, resulting in a fast turnaround for claims\u2013 often within the same day. This is especially valuable for catastrophe claims, allowing damages to be assessed and reported almost instantly. \u201cThe remote inspection tool provides excellent features to provide a quick property survey without being in the field. You can gather valuable property information and identify its general physical conditions. The tool is also effective at follow-up risk improvements and repairs.\u201d \u2013 David Irizarry Risk Solutions Engineer, Optima Seguros Help When Customers Need it Most The Remote Inspection Tool provides innovative claims management solutions that speed the process of recovery for everyone, helping people when they need it most. Feedback from both policyholders and adjusters has been overwhelmingly positive, with users finding the tool easy and fast to use, efficient and convenient. Policyholders enjoy the convenience of not having to wait for an appointment with an adjuster and benefit from expedited claims settlements. Many of them are surprised to be offered such a simple and effective service. \u201cWhat I really like about the video inspection tool is that it provides new options to my clients. In times when the policyholder is difficult to reach, because of Corona or after a natural disaster this tool is a great answer to the question of how to quickly and competently handle claims without physical contact but once you have experienced it, it quickly becomes clear what potential the tool has in terms of time and cost savings.\u201d \u2013 Tobias Heister Client Manager, Munich Re Since deployment, Optima Seguros has done more than 400 remote inspections, the tool is firmly integrated into their claims and underwriting processes. \u201cFrom the point of view of an insurer the remote inspection tool is very attractive and can be managed easily. It reduces the lifetime of the claim, cutting the time of travel for the field adjuster, and giving us the power to grow our business without hiring more adjusters\u2026 it has given Optima Seguros a competitive advantage amongst our industry peers.\u201d Don\u2019t Let Years of Wisdom Walk Out the Door Connect with us today to build a plan for capturing knowledge and reducing revenue loss Get a Demo Get Connected!

When visual assistance is servitized, companies can expand their revenue streams to include the services and solutions for their products as well as the product itself. Visual Assistance adds more value to the service contracts and can be used to drive service contract sales. Servitization is the strategy of monetizing service packages to create even more value for customers and establish long-term relationships with their customers while increasing satisfaction and loyalty. Visual assistance is a key differentiator for customers and can itself be converted into a commercial product for service organizations. At SightCall, we\u2019ve seen several ways that enterprises integrate remote visual assistance into service offerings to generate additional revenue: Offering Visual Assistance as part of a Service Agreement Only Remote visual assistance can be offered as a premium-level feature to customers willing to invest in an end-to-end service agreement. The benefits of services that include AR-powered live video are attractive to customers who are willing to pay for top-of-line service. The advantages of visual support make it attractive to customers wanting an effortless service contract, especially with companies that are sensitive to downtime. Visual assistance can increase the attractiveness of a responsive emergency service contract that\u2019s available 24/7. Additionally, visual assistance can be used to provide a premium \u201cwhite glove\u201d service for customers that demand excellent service or have high-value products where downtime must be kept to a minimum. SightCall can be deployed as a custom branded visual assistance app to streamline services for users. Koenig & Bauer\u2019s Visual Press Support, powered by SightCall, enables them to successfully solve almost 80% of their service cases with remote maintenance solutions. Their customers say that they have never experienced such a \u201cunique\u201d and \u201csimple\u201d way of communicating with service technicians. Likewise, SightCall\u2019s customer Sciex reports that 64% of their customers\u2019 problems are now resolved remotely, through multiple service offerings. Offering Visual Assistance Free During a Warranty Period In this model, a service organization offers remote visual assistance as part of a warranty phase free of charge, with an option to continue benefiting from the service for a fee. Customers who experience the value of the additional level of service and support with remote visual assistance will be more comfortable upgrading after their warranty expires. For example, while Koenig & Bauer\u2019s customers\u2019 machines are under warranty, they have the option to access a video session with remote assist experts who use a robust set of AR and AI tools at their disposal to aid in troubleshooting and self-repair. When an in-person visit is required, the process is streamlined by determining exactly what the issue is and the needed tools and expertise to ensure a quick resolution. Data collected on first-time fix rates and reduced downtime of machines can further justify the return on investment for upgrading to a comprehensive service agreement. Offering Visual Support as an Add-on Service\ufeff \ufeff As a bridge between these two approaches, some clients have found revenue opportunities by offering a pay-as-you-go service that includes remote visual assistance, paid for by the hour Customers can access visual support calls on an ad-hoc basis. As live video allows for quicker problem resolution, this is often an attractive option to customers who are less cash-rich but still need a support option.For Sciex, the global leader in life science and analytical technologies, customers that opt out of a full-service contract can infer a significant amount of risk because Sciex machines are complex and can be quite costly to fix or replace. Within their non-contract Assisted Service offering, Sciex has found an opportunity to leverage its remote visual assistance capabilities. By offering pay-as-you-go visual support from remote experts, Sciex can generate an additional revenue stream while supporting their non-contract customers when they need it most and deterring them from going to a 3rd party to initiate the fix instead. Customers with at least two visual support calls a year are saving approximately three times the amount they would pay for a full-service contract with the company. By adding visual support to their offering, customers get the support and expertise they need at a cost that works for them, and Sciex can expand revenue streams through existing accounts. Offering visual remote support to customers is a win for everyone involved, enabling service organizations to provide exceptional service for their customers while increasing efficiency and opening new revenue streams through servitization.

In the rush to add video to your service options, thinking of it as just another added feature can often lead to failure. When deployed correctly, remote visual support will net substantial ROI for service organizations, improving key metrics while reducing truck rolls. Before getting started, we suggest asking the right questions to find the best solution for your needs. Here are five of the most common mistakes we see: 1. Thinking of remote visual support like Skype or Facetime Remote visual support isn\u2019t simply a video call. It\u2019s a platform built with a powerful set of features to help you see a problem someone is facing and guide them to a resolution more quickly. Rather than just explaining the problem over a visual support call, an on-site technician or customer can show the problem or task to an expert located anywhere. The remote expert isn\u2019t just a voice or a face asking questions. With a powerful platform like SightCall, they can control the on-site technician\u2019s phone to zoom in, activate the flashlight, and take photos of what they need. Using the Optical Character Reader, the remote expert can capture text from serial or model numbers to quickly reference. If there are instructions or relevant materials, the expert can drop those documents into the call instantly for the on-site user to reference. The remote expert can also use AR features and annotations to draw or illustrate right on the on-site device. With just a video call you\u2019d still end up spending a lot of time saying things like \u201cLook for the panel at the top right.\u201d With annotations and other tools, the expert can directly markup the video image to illustrate live the steps to resolving issues in much the same way as if they were on-site themselves. In addition to these features allowing clear communication and collaboration that recreate in-person conditions, they go beyond by seamlessly folding in the data from the session into the existing workflow. Once a task is completed the video and photos taken during the session, along with any resources shared, are saved right into the work order for future reference. 2. You\u2019re trying to build your own visual support platform Over the last ten years, we\u2019ve sat at the table with countless corporations, system integrators, and CRMS that have tried to create their own live video support tool. They\u2019ve spent millions on development and millions on research. They\u2019ve been told it can\u2019t be done for many reasons, including that they wouldn\u2019t be able to support the product even if they can produce it. Building and maintaining a communication platform isn\u2019t a do-it-yourself solution. We don\u2019t build our own fax machines, phones, or email systems. We rely on experts to do it for us. Using a robust and proven solution like SightCall allows you to kickstart your digital transformation in a way that integrates into your established tools and workflows. Built by telecom experts, we own, manage and operate our own platform, giving us the freedom to continually evolve and set the standard for visual assistance. Customers can leverage our pre-built partnerships, deploy on our standalone platform or create a custom branded and white-glove application with our technology. 3. You\u2019re making your customer and service agent the \u201cface\u201d of visual support Unless you need to confirm someone\u2019s identity or have a telemedicine use case, there are few reasons why face-to-face matters in service operations. With remote visual support, using the rear-facing camera is key. It\u2019s more important to see what the on-site person sees than their face. The goal is to have an illustrative conversation using a combination of tools to inspect and evaluate an issue and offer solutions. Take a lesson from Amazon\u2019s failure with Mayday. Launched in 2013, Amazon Mayday was a support tool that initiated a face-to-face video interaction between customers and customer service. Studies show that customers are more inclined than ever to try and \u201cself solve\u201d problems \u2013 one reason being that they don\u2019t want another person in their home. If the use case doesn\u2019t require being face-to-face, scrap it for a use case that makes sense. 4. You are unaware of your compliance obligations In every industry, there are regularly updated guidelines and requirements for security and data protection that require compliance. Video call software such as Skype, Facetime, or Whatsapp, is used widely for personal communication but isn\u2019t robust enough to protect the data of your customers or employees. Dedicated solutions for remote visual support are built on systems that prioritize safety and compliance. For anyone in the healthcare industry, HIPPA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) compliance is not optional. It consists of a series of interlocking regulatory rules that protect patients, physicians, and all healthcare providers. SightCall has been designed specifically to offer visual remote support consistent with full compliance with these regulations, empowering telehealth services, medical equipment servicing, and healthcare sales and services with powerful virtual tools. Other industries require compliance with GDPR, CCPA, or similar regulations. SightCall prioritizes security and compliance that exceed industry standards, as demonstrated by an annual SOC 2 Type II Certification \u2013 an independent verification based on trust services criteria. 5. You\u2019re not integrating remote visual support into your current business process Implementing remote visual support as a separate system from your regular business processes will lead to problems of redundancy and inefficiency. Siloed data will prevent your remote experts from having the information they need to assist end-users, and data gathered from the video session will be similarly limited unless manually entered back into the CRM or ticketing system. By integrating visual assistance into your existing systems and processes, you ensure not only that all data is in one place, but also that you can measure the success of your virtual tools. SightCall\u2019s flexibility and integrations enable video sessions to be launched from within the platform of record. Whether you\u2019re using Salesforce, ServiceNow, ServiceMax, Zendesk, or a proprietary system, by using the platform within your workflow you reduce barriers to adoption and can access what you need to ensure success. Choosing the right visual assistance solution is more than adding video to your existing model. Avoiding these common mistakes will allow you to quickly reap the benefits of remote visual support including increasing customer satisfaction and productivity by leveraging experts with less physical travel to resolve issues or complete tasks quickly the first time. To learn more, see how SightCall has successfully transformed support for companies like Koenig & Bauer and contact our team of experts to discuss your visual assistance needs.

A few years ago, the use of augmented reality (AR) and artificial intelligence (AI), either to augment or supplement in-person inspections, was more of an abstract concept than widespread reality. But the emergence of COVID-19 in 2020 jolted these developments forward. Suddenly, its use seemed to be everywhere, and its reach continues to grow. Measuring the transformation shaped by the use of remote technologies in the inspection of offshore vessels, a headline in a leading maritime industry magazine recently declared it \u201cDeus ex machina.\u201d In terms of transformative impact, this is hardly an exaggeration. Virtually every industry has been forced to ride steep waves of change in this past \u201cyear of losses,\u201d as McKinsey & Company put it. While many of the shifts businesses had to embrace are set to become more permanent, it remains to be seen whether or not other changes will be gradually phased out. As optimism about the post-COVID economy continues to increase, leaders will take stock of what the pandemic revealed about their operations and business models. With this said, it\u2019s a safe bet that AR and AI technologies will continue upward trajectories of adoption. At SightCall, we have been inspired by the resilience of companies large and small throughout this crisis. We occupy a unique vantage point, offering high-caliber remote assistance solutions that cushioned the impact of operational disruptions while empowering businesses to realize long-term ambitions of more digital and borderless customer service. This has hardly been more evident in the use of AI- and AR-powered video calls to perform remote video inspection. With a video calling platform quickly and easily nestled within existing customer relationship management (CRM) software, companies have deployed safe and accurate assessments of facilities and equipment anywhere in the world, respecting health regulations and cost constraints. Integration needs are only the beginning for companies implementing these solutions. For example, Bureau Veritas\u2019s marine and offshore division recently engaged SightCall to grow its remote classification survey capabilities. With in-person inspections involving significant time and cost, and becoming increasingly difficult and potentially dangerous in the context of COVID-19, the company could count on high picture and video quality, even in low-bandwidth conditions, along with quick recognition and feedback of site data without the need for manual entry. Bureau Veritas accessed SightCall sessions with any vessel on a wide range of devices, debuting its first drone-operated survey in March 2020. The results included a significantly reduced risk to workers, the minimization of on-site survey costs and the ability to make effective decisions from a distance. Another customer, a food and beverage company operating in more than 40 countries, shifted to video in lieu of performing in-person safety inspections of suppliers and co-packers. Virtually transforming the inspection process allowed them to identify and resolve potential food safety and supply chain issues while reducing the risk of product contamination or employee infection. On the SightCall platform, inspectors have more than just video access \u2013 they are able to perform inspections in a secure and stable environment, augmented with features that allow them to perform routine tasks and share knowledge as if they were onsite. Transitioning to remote inspections with SightCall, this company realized more efficiency in their traditional processes. Site visits that often took days, including planning and travel time, could now be resolved in a single session lasting a few hours. In addition to minimizing travel costs and reducing carbon footprint, they were now able to securely save and store data from inspections that had not previously been collected during in-person visits. The positive transformation enabled by AI- and AR-powered remote inspections, making operations more flexible, less costly and safer, seems to guarantee it will remain a highly sought-after capability in a variety of industries. The companies that have already embraced this technology are arguably ahead of the curve \u2013 changing their industries for the better and forcing the competition to rise to the occasion or be left behind.

Take this Harvard Business Review piece about the concept of \u201c Disruptive Innovation.\u201d We imagine systems being upended, processes redone and the ways we\u2019re used to doing things eliminated. And we think while some people may benefit, many others will lose. Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies hold transformative potential for the way people engage with and in their work, despite the misunderstandings that abound, perhaps defined by the clich\u00e9d picture of robots quietly gliding along factory floors with barely a human in sight. From tech novices to seasoned experts, people have a tendency to think big about AI \u2013 in fact, maybe too big. First, we must center ourselves around the positive realities of AI in order to truly benefit from it. That starts with defining the terms of the game. Rather than seeing AI as a transactional process of winners and losers, we can embrace the view endorsed by Accenture executive and author Paul Daugherty, who explains this technology in mathematical terms. \u201cHuman plus machine equals superpowers,\u201d he said a few years back, describing a collaborative process that drew on the strength of each side. Machines are good at repetition, people at communication and creativity \u2013 with each augmenting, not replacing, the best qualities of the other. The second point is not to restrict AI to bold, grand projects, while overlooking what it can do to transform more ordinary aspects of day-to-day operations. For example, while businesses recognize the power of employing new technology to improve their processes, just a few years ago well over half worried they wouldn\u2019t be able to keep up with the pace of technological change. But fears of speed could prove misplaced if those companies are strategic about their AI use. In 2018, the HBR published a study of 152 projects in more than 200 companies, concluding that applying AI to highly-ambitious projects was actually less effective than adoption in so-called \u201clow-hanging fruit\u201d projects, ones that were simple implementations and enhanced everyday business processes. Additionally, more than half of chief executives surveyed said that AI enhanced the features, functions and performance of products, and just under 40% said workers were freed to focus on more creative tasks and made better decisions. As for some of their concerns, about half identified integration barriers as an obstacle, referring to tech that could not be scaled quickly or that did not fit into existing systems. Few companies want or can afford to totally reinvent the wheel. Our own experience at SightCall, refined over 12+ years of experience, is that companies have embraced solutions like ours to enhance their workforce processes in a range of industries. From auto manufacturers to doctors\u2019 offices, our ability to leverage best-in-class technologies on our AI- and augmented reality (AR)-enabled remote video call platform has eased their ability to fine-tune their business models. Features like optical character recognition, on-screen annotations and solid capabilities even in low-bandwidth environments are well-received. But what we\u2019ve noticed above all is how companies require close integrations with their existing systems, plus the ability to rapidly upscale. Both are essential tools to applying AI to the \u201clow-hanging fruit\u201d of operations. For example, with the SightCall platform able to be quickly incorporated into a manufacturer\u2019s existing Salesforce CRM, the tool can be effectively inserted into that company\u2019s effort to implement global machine maintenance operations. If the service expert with the best answer to a pressing maintenance question in England is based in Japan, it takes only the click of a button to connect one to the other. In the not-so-distant future, we may witness the emergence of a subtitle-based translation feature that breaks down language and other communication barriers between workers and experts across the globe. With the right uses and, perhaps more importantly, the right expectations, artificial intelligence is destined to change what we imagine from the term \u201cdisruption.\u201d Far from being sidelined, workers will find themselves at the heart of more responsive and efficient enterprises, freed to create, question and reimagine what is possible.

The \u201cnew normal\u201d of business that emerged in a highly disruptive 2020 demonstrated the growing potential to make workplaces in nearly every industry safer, more efficient and more responsive to customer needs. There is no question we have arrived in this new era more quickly than expected. For example, one study by management consultant McKinsey & Company noted that while roughly 33% of customer interactions were digital in December 2019, this figure had increased to 58% in July of 2020. Set against previous trends, this amounted to a three-year acceleration in just six months. It is intuitive that if employees and workers are set to interact with more customers digitally in the future, their training should also be digital. But there\u2019s much more to it than that. Our clients at SightCall have found that augmented reality (AR) and artificial intelligence (AI)-driven training empowers workers to gain hands-on skills, validating research that technology-driven, experiential learning can improve retention rates up to 75%. Cultivating more self-sufficient workers cut down on multiple visits to a job site, allowing them to be guided by a remote expert through solutions in real time. A more immediate, cost-effective training model emerges as a result, all by incorporating the single technological solution of an integrated video calling platform. To start, there is ample evidence to suggest immersive instruction offers greater benefits than traditional, classroom-based teaching, unleashing more confident, agile employees. One consultant who has worked with small and mid-sized manufacturers shared with IndustryWeek that, regardless of the learning style of the engineers, machinists and assembly technicians he trained, classroom instruction frequently resulted in distractions and low information retention. In order for the concepts to penetrate the brain\u2019s frontal cortex, he said, workers needed to go to a machine in the shop and learn kinesthetically. The consultant called it \u201clearning by doing.\u201d Indeed, the more that technicians can learn skills on the job, the less time they need to spend in classroom instruction or buried in training manuals. As Training magazine observed in 2017, the average small business spent up to $1 million a year on training budgets, with some $1,886 spent per worker. Significant potential exists for companies to overcome the negative effect on their bottom lines and get back to more productive activities while turning to technology. In early 2020, with the COVID-19 pandemic raging, movements restricted and safety concerns paramount, industrial fire protection manufacturer Fike partnered with us through their Salesforce customer relationship manager to remotely train junior technicians. Using SightCall\u2019s high-definition video calling sessions launched through Salesforce work orders, expert technicians guided their peers through troubleshooting issues on machines. With universal reliability and ease-of-use, even skeptics of the idea of virtual assistance found great satisfaction in completing work orders quickly \u2013 and in getting the job done themselves. Furthermore, Fike increased the size and scale of their technician workforce and improved service results. The experience of GE Healthcare, which is integrated with ServiceMax CRM, offers another example. This company employs SightCall in multiple geographic regions to maintain and repair product families of medical imaging and ultrasound machines, which a trial had found were most responsive to remote-guided repairs. Even relatively-inexperienced technicians could troubleshoot machines in a matter of hours \u2013 rather than days prior to SightCall\u2019s implementation \u2013 with the aid of touchless capabilities, high-definition picture and optical character recognition that reads and feeds back data to the work order or internal product search engine. With a reduction of repetitive tasks, toggling back and forth between several devices and repeat trips, workers\u2019 minds absorb the details of a job that matter, and take away pivotal lessons for next time. Streamlined processes and smarter workers produce a greater engagement within companies, and drive results that reinforce the bottom line. There is no better place to start than at the beginning, and introducing AI and AR into training processes prepares businesses and their workers for the exciting digital future upon us.

SightCall partnered with Copperberg to produce a report on The State of AI in Field Service. The report highlights findings gathered from a large number of companies serving almost every industry\u2014from automotive and machinery to food and beverage with the goal of determining to what extent field service is poised for broader AI adoption. The research shows that today\u2019s field service organizations are craving for AI capabilities that can help them improve customer satisfaction, reduce human errors, share information more transparently, enhance employee satisfaction, and increase worker safety. Since 2008, SightCall has been improving the communication of world-class service organizations with the transformational power of AR and AI-powered visual assistance. Thomas Cottereau co-founded SightCall to unleash real-time communication and bring it into the field to deliver new experiences in service. We sat down with him to learn more about his thoughts on the future of AI and how it will evolve to optimize technician experiences. Q: In the survey, 37% of field service leaders indicated that they perceive AI as hard to deploy. Do you agree with this perception and what do you think can be done to make it less challenging? A: It\u2019s interesting to see that so many survey respondents, more than half, identified AI as either useful or essential to field service, but a large number also indicated that it was hard to deploy. Rather than thinking of AI as a weighty additional platform or technology that needs to be built from the ground up, companies can select solutions that already embed AI as part of their offering. This means the solution provider is doing all of the hard backend work to integrate AI into their platform. Now it is easier for you to consume and you benefit from all of the AI capabilities without having to deploy it yourself. A platform like SightCall gives you the benefits of AI without the AI headache. Now imagine that every time your technician arrives at their job site, they know exactly what work needs to be done and have all the correct skill and tools to complete it. That\u2019s what the right AI achieves. It eliminates skills gaps and even language barriers. It gives technicians smart resources at the touch of a button that can help with predictive analysis and recommendations. AI is arriving in field service not in one giant deployment, but through a myriad of features and systems that all work together to empower your technicians and supercharge your service offerings. If service leaders keep this in mind and continue to bring AI-focused partners into their technology stack, they\u2019ll be poised for greater success. Not only will you begin to benefit from AI across your workflows, but you\u2019ll also benefit from experts that are continuously improving AI capabilities and are on hand to help you implement them. Great technology partners, including SightCall, can also help with the most intimidating parts of the process \u2013 like feeding your AI engine with the data they need to recognize the products and equipment your technicians use daily, enabling automated processes and predictive maintenance. \u201cAI is arriving in field service not in one giant deployment, but through a myriad of features and systems that all work together to empower your technicians and supercharge your service offerings.\u201d \u2013 Thomas Cottereau CEO, SightCall Q: How does visual assistance leverage AI to empower field service organizations? A: Visual assistance with AI technology uses continuous data evaluation and processing to streamline scheduling, dispatch, and maintenance processes. With live translation, language barriers are removed, allowing the technician with the most applicable skills to complete tasks no matter where they are located. AI translation works for both speech and visual text which also empowers on-site technicians to easily interpret relevant signs, labels, instructions, or product information. Image recognition can provide technicians with live recommendations based on images extracted during visual support sessions to identify products, diagnose problems, and propose solutions. Data and photos taken from the session can be identified and fed back into an AI engine to improve future insights and recommendations. We\u2019ve already seen that visual assistance can eliminate unnecessary truck rolls and reduce parts wastage. With AI features we ensure that technicians have everything they need to provide excellent service quickly and efficiently the first time. Q: 43% of Field Service Organizations reported that they are using video to resolve issues remotely. For service leaders who haven\u2019t considered visual assistance yet, what are the benefits they can expect to see? A: Visual assistance platforms like SightCall improve both the customer and technician experience to allow organizations to deliver better service. Our platform helps organizations collect, share and deliver service knowledge so all technicians can work at their maximum potential, regardless of their experience level or expertise. By empowering technicians to perform their tasks through a streamlined remote process, we\u2019ve seen increased efficiency realized through truck roll reduction, parts optimization, improved fix rates, improved equipment uptimes, reduced training times, and an increase in customer satisfaction. Q: What do you see as the future of AI in field service and where do you think AI can take us? A: I have no doubt that the future of AI in field service is a future where technicians and service agents are augmented by technology to perform at their absolute best. This study shows how many field service organizations already see the value in AI to help them with improving customer service and technician satisfaction along with reducing errors and increasing safety and transparency. Many are already starting to deploy AI in parts of their organization or planning on doing so soon. As AI adoption increases and customers continue to demand faster service, we see a move towards more predictive and automated maintenance. For organizations who are just starting on this journey, it\u2019s important to understand that integrating AI into a field service organization is a process, one that can start with features that eliminate barriers to performing service tasks and moves towards providing analysis and recommendations.

Advancements in medical science are happening fast. Medical device technology is evolving at warp speed. And manufacturers seem to be closing the gap between reality and science fiction. But no matter how bright and bold the future looks, machines will still break. They will still need people to fix them. That\u2019s why medical device manufacturers need to make sure their service organization can keep up with changing times. 1. Artificial Intelligence (AI) What is it? Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. AI systems can be trained to perform a wide range of tasks, such as recognizing speech, playing games, making predictions, and controlling robots. Popular AI techniques include: Machine learning (ML) \u2013 a method of teaching a computer to learn from data, without being explicitly programmed. Natural Language Processing (NLP ) \u2013 a form of AI that enables machines to understand, interpret and generate human language, such as speech and text. Computer vision \u2013 A form of AI that enables machines to interpret and understand the visual world, such as recognizing images, videos and understanding the context. Why does it matter? AI-powered medical devices can analyze vast amounts of data and provide more accurate diagnostic results. For example, AI algorithms can be used to analyze images from medical imaging devices, such as X-rays and MRIs, to identify signs of disease or injury. MedTech Dive reported that \u201cresearchers at MIT have developed a deep learning model that can predict individuals\u2019 risk of lung cancer six years into the future from a single low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) scan.\u201d \u201c69% of healthcare organizations are piloting or adopting AI.\u201d \u2013 Accenture, 2020 What does it mean for service? AI tools have gained momentum when it comes to areas like diagnosis, risk prediction, clinical decision support, and resource management. But clinical applications are currently facing more scrutiny and hurdles. An article from the Pew Trust notes that the FDA \u201cis currently considering how to adapt its review process for AI-enabled medical devices that have the ability to evolve rapidly in response to new data, sometimes in ways that are difficult to foresee.\u201d In terms of how AI functions in medical devices in the healthcare setting? The story is still being written. When it comes to utilizing AI in the service of medical devices (AI empowered or otherwise), there are clear benefits. Operational and performance data from machines can be obtained and analyzed to predict and prevent issues. And computer vision can be deployed to make the service process more efficient. SightCall is currently working with a leading medical device manufacturer to design and deploy a computer vision feature that will assist in identifying specific parts that need to be replaced. The result will lead to a much more efficient service workflow and streamline the parts replacement process. 2. Virtual & Augmented Reality What is it? Virtual reality (VR) refers to a computer-generated simulation of a three-dimensional environment that can be interacted with using specialized equipment, such as a VR headset. The simulated environment can include visual, auditory, and haptic (tactile) elements, and can be designed to be like the real world or completely imaginary. Augmented reality (AR) is a technology that superimposes computer-generated images, sounds, or other information onto real-world scenes, in real time. This creates the illusion of virtual objects existing in the real world, and can be experienced through devices such as smartphones, tablets, and specialized headsets. Why does it matter? While VR has become popular in terms of entertainment and video games, the technology is a powerful tool for education. Advanced graphics and fluid interfaces can give people the sense of being completely immersed in the task at hand. Pilots and soldiers have trained using VR for years, but so have physicians, researchers, and surgeons. Virtual reality gives medical professionals the ability to practice and master complex procedures before involving patients. Healthcare facilities are also currently using AR for everything from training and surgery assistance to hospital navigation and drug development. \u201cImmersive VR training in healthcare can improve performance 230-300%\u201d \u2013 Osso VR What does it mean for service? Broadly, it\u2019s safe to say that we\u2019ll be seeing more VR/AR medical devices being used in healthcare environments. Decades of development have refined virtual reality technology. Today\u2019s VR simulations are much less like blocky, wonky video games and getting closer every day to a more convincing reality. That enhanced clarity has made it easier to incorporate VR into clinical applications like therapy and counseling, where it can be used to create immersive environments. The evolution of wearable AR devices has made it practical for doctors to use AR technology for things like viewing patient charts and demonstrating procedures. There are even handheld AR devices in use that can visualize veins for more accurate blood draws and IV placement. In terms of using the technologies as tools, service organizations have been all-in on VR/AR from the start. Modern field technicians regularly rely on them to add layers of vital information during service calls through special eyewear or on their tablets and smartphones. The biggest benefit on-site is the elevated clarity that AR can provide. Using AR tools gives you the ability to see beyond the big picture \u2026 and even through walls. Overlaying digital information on top of reality is an excellent way to provide real-time guidance and instruction between field engineers. It can reduce errors and speed the repair process. 3. Data Integration What is it? Data integration refers to the process of combining data from multiple sources into a single, unified view. This can include extracting data from different formats, cleaning and transforming the data, and loading it into a common repository or data warehouse. Why does it matter? In hospitals and healthcare environments, data is king. From the recording of vital signs like blood pressure, temperature, and pulse, to results from more complex tests and scans, medical staff depend on data to inform every action and decision. The goal of many hospitals is to move away from siloed data that comes from independent sources and devices. Instead of manually inputting this data into one system, the dream of integration is that all information is automatically sent to the same place. In an article on the importance of bringing all that data together, GE Healthcare noted that \u201cMedical device integration moves hospitals to the next level, freeing clinical staff to do what they were trained to do and allowing hospitals to reduce variations, become more efficient, and improve financial and clinical outcomes.\u201d \u201c95% of healthcare data that\u2019s collected goes unused.\u201d \u2013 HealthLeaders 2023 What does it mean for service? Today, the healthcare industry generates approximately 30% of the world\u2019s data volume. And that number\u2019s compound annual growth rate is expected to reach 36% by 2025! ( RBC Capital Market ). Hospitals have come a long way from clipboards that hang at the foot of a patient\u2019s bed. Collecting information in handwritten charts is now the exception. Digital data rules. Integrated medical devices help eliminate human error. Replacing pen and paper processes and the manual compilation of disparate data saves time and money. But for service, the biggest advantage of the new age of integrated and connected devices is that many of them can also share information about themselves. Having a direct line that allows service teams to \u201ctalk\u201d with complex medical devices is a huge advantage when it comes to repairs and maintenance. While true remote servicing may only be an option for some issues in some devices, the ability to troubleshoot a device before arriving on site is a huge cost saver. 4. Wearable Tech What is it? Wearable technology refers to electronic devices or equipment that can be worn on the body as an accessory, either as an extension of a smartphone or as a standalone device. These devices are designed to collect, monitor, and provide feedback on various physiological and environmental data. Examples include smartwatches, fitness trackers, smart glasses, and smart clothing. These devices can be used to track physical activity, monitor vital signs, and provide notifications and other information to the user. Why does it matter? Reports predict that the wearable device industry will reach close to $380.5 billion by 2028. Wearables have completely changed the healthcare equation. While many of us have used trackers for fitness, more companies are making devices for critical care, at-home treatment, and the long-term management of serious illnesses. Advances in technology give doctors an unprecedented ability to monitor patients in real-time, reducing the need for in-person visits. This puts wearables in a real position to become an important part of the healthcare system \u201cfront lines.\u201d What happens when you don\u2019t have to visit your doctor for a quick vitals check? All you need to do is glance at your wrist. Want to do your own sleep study? Monitor irregular heart activity? Send your contraction cycle in real-time to your OB/GYN? No problem. Wearable tech has become much more accessible and effective. The devices are getting smarter\u2026 and smaller. And there is a whole new wave of devices that are implantable, ingestible, and injectable. \u201c30% of American adults use a wearable healthcare device. Nearly 50% use it every day, with more than 80% willing to share the data with their provider.\u201d \u2013 Patterns of Use and Key Predictors for the Use of Wearable Health Care Devices by US Adults 2020 What does it mean for service? It\u2019s hard to say. Because many wearables are sold as consumer products, manufacturers will need, at minimum, an advanced and robust customer service platform that can assist with setup, operation questions and maintenance. But high costs of equipment may push trends towards rental or subscription models. And since wearables will be constantly connected, digital security will be a top priority. In terms of service, future challenges will be as varied as the devices themselves. 5. Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) What is it? The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) refers to the network of medical devices, equipment, and other objects that are connected to the internet and can collect, share, and analyze data. These devices can include wearables, as well as more specialized equipment, such as blood glucose monitors, pacemakers, and diagnostic equipment. IoMT devices often use wireless communication technologies such as Bluetooth, WiFi, and cellular networks to transmit data to cloud-based platforms, where it can be analyzed and shared with healthcare professionals. Why does it matter? The IoMT gives healthcare organizations a powerful tool when it comes to collecting and organizing data. It gives doctors the ability to monitor patients remotely and inside the hospital. But it can also solve a big problem for larger health systems struggling to manage assets and inventory. RFID tags and sensors can be used to track and manage medical equipment, such as wheelchairs and IV pumps, and ensure that they are in the right place at the right time. IoT devices can also be used to track and manage medications and supplies and ensure that they\u2019re available when needed. \u201cGlobally, the healthcare industry had the highest percentage increase in weekly cyberattacks of any industry sector, with an increase of 74% from 2021 to an average of 1,463 attacks per week.\u201d \u2013 HIPAA Journal 2023 What does this mean for service? Above and beyond the value that IoMT provides for collecting patient data, connected facilities are cutting costs when it comes to asset management and inventory. Today the IoMT can provide real-time asset tracking for medical devices like carts, beds, and wheelchairs. It can even monitor patients, staff, and visitors. A connected community of devices is a net positive for med device companies who can rely on technology that talks back to anticipate and prevent operational issues. In terms of inventory and asset management, devices are much easier to fix when they can be found. And a robust IoMT network allows for remote performance tracking and predictive maintenance. The Bottom Line Technology is a bullet train that doesn\u2019t make local stops. If you keep up with the healthcare technology headlines, you\u2019ll read something amazing every day. The bottom line for medical device manufacturers is to make sure that the rest of your business is keeping pace with the speed of change. Because even if your product is a shining example of the scientific cutting edge, your service organization needs to be just as innovative. Behind every big tech breakthrough is an opportunity to improve your service and support the evolution of your product.

According to the State of Customer Experience research by Genesys, more than half of surveyed companies prioritize Customer Experience (CX) at the board level. That means CX leaders need to adopt habits that consistently drive customer satisfaction and loyalty. And a white paper from NICE and Aberdeen shows that CX leaders who embrace CX-fluency, that is the streamlining of a company\u2019s tools and processes for CX improvement purposes, retain 81% of their customers, as opposed to the 63% retained by companies that don\u2019t. Here are five habits effective CX-fluid contact center leaders can cultivate towards fostering quality customer engagement: Habit #1: Harbor a Customer-Centric Mindset Customers are the lifeblood of any company, so prioritize their needs and show them you\u2019re working toward meeting their expectations. Here\u2019s how: Develop a deep understanding of customer journeys, pain points, and preferences, guiding your decision-making to deliver exceptional customer experiences. Act as a champion for the customer experience at all levels of the organization, effectively communicating its importance to senior leadership. Ensure customer experience goals receive the necessary support and resources. Treat customer concerns as you would your own, taking responsibility for issues and disputes and prioritizing efficient FCR (first contact resolution) to show the customer you\u2019re committed to hearing them and getting them the answers and assistance, they need. Habit #2: Prioritize Data-Driven Decision Making & Embrace Modern Technology To avoid operating in the dark, leverage data and the latest technologies to drive decisions, ensuring each customer feels valued and recognized. Here\u2019s how: Leverage customer feedback, performance metrics, and operational data to gain insights into their behavior and identify areas for improvement. Stay informed about the latest customer service tools and innovations and utilize technologies like predictive AI to optimize customer interactions. Assess and adopt technology solutions that align with your customer experience objectives, enhancing efficiency and ensuring every customer feels genuinely heard and satisfied. Habit #3: Foster Cross-Departmental Collaboration for a Unified Focus Collaboration with other departments and stakeholders is vital. Here\u2019s how to do it: Setup regular meetings with marketing, operations, IT, and product development to align strategies and share valuable insights you are gathering directly from customers. Champion customer-focused strategies across all departments, ensuring that the customer remains central to the organization\u2019s endeavors Habit #4: Prioritize Employee Engagement for Optimal Service Delivery Head counts and budgets for customer service staff are increasing by up to 50% at most companies surveyed, and CX leaders must recognize the importance of engaged and empowered employees in delivering exceptional customer experiences. Here\u2019s how: Invest in comprehensive training and development. Foster a positive work culture that champions open communication, ensuring that team members are both motivated and well-equipped. Ensure employees are equipped with the tools. Establish a service-oriented culture that promotes efficiency, loyalty, and trust among both team members and customers. Habit #5: Embrace the Journey of Continuous Improvement To deliver outstanding customer service, CX leaders stay committed to the path of continuous improvement. Here\u2019s how: Cultivate a culture of learning and innovation within the contact center. Encourage teams to seek out new ideas, test new approaches, and welcome transformative changes. To improve customer service conflict resolution, try new approaches and employ new processes Tap into customer feedback, regularly sharing it with your team. The Future of CX Leadership Contact centers are almost always a customer\u2019s first point of communication when reaching out to a company. How long they continue to do business with you can be decided entirely by their experience when they access your contact center\u2014 31% of customers stopped using a company after a negative interaction in the past year ( Genesys ). By instilling these five habits, CX leaders can drive positive change, align the organization with customer-centric goals, and ensure exceptional experiences. In doing so, they don\u2019t just retain customers but also uphold the age-old wisdom of quality as a consistent habit.

The problem is that nobody can predict exactly where it will hit, how long it will last or what kind of damage it will do. Every financial expert has their own opinion. One says the sky is falling and another advises us to keep calm and carry on. Deciding who to believe can be overwhelming. But here\u2019s the thing, there\u2019s always a storm coming. The global economy has always been, and always will be, unpredictable. Sometimes it\u2019s just a wild market fluctuation. Sometimes it\u2019s a global health crisis that triggers bigger problems like supply chain disruption and workforce shortages. Other times it can be a full-blown recession. Nobody knows for sure until everybody knows. So instead of trying to guess exactly what\u2019s coming, sometimes the best strategy is to keep moving forward and prepare for the worst. Nothing has the power to move you forward faster than investing in digital technology. The hard truth about \u201crecession-proof\u201d The most successful companies in the world stay afloat and thrive because they\u2019ve learned how to navigate rough waters. And they know there is no such thing as \u201crecession-proof.\u201d During times of economic uncertainty, there are a million factors we cannot control. Materials costs. Fuel prices. World politics. The best strategy is to focus on what you can control, which is your company. Your people. Your process. There\u2019s no doubt that technology can help. A 2021 Digital Transformation Executive Survey from Deloitte found that \u201cmore digitally integrated organizations measurably outperformed on their strategic objectives, capacity to change, and ability to win.\u201d Embracing digital innovation can mean the difference between merely surviving a recession and coming through it even stronger. But technology is not magic. There\u2019s no single app or device powerful enough to make your business immune to the effects of wide-scale financial disruption. The good news? While digital innovation won\u2019t make your company recession-proof, it can make it \u201crecession-resilient.\u201d Learn how to bend without breaking In 1906, a massive earthquake rocked San Francisco and destroyed over 80% of the city. That disaster spawned an engineering challenge that continues to this day: How do you design and construct buildings that will bend without breaking? While no building is 100% earthquake-proof, advances in materials and technology have led to structures that are more resilient and safer than any other time in history. Instead of falling apart, the buildings sway and bend to absorb some of the seismic shifts. They remain flexible in the face of massive shock and disruption. Adopting and integrating new technologies can do the same for your company. It can help you bend without breaking. This is especially important since the National Bureau of Economic Research defines a recession as \u201ca significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy, lasting more than a few months.\u201d We\u2019re not talking about battening down the hatches for a quick storm. Economic downturns have been known to drag on for a while so it\u2019s important to plan for the long haul. And to make matters even worse, there\u2019s always another financial disruption waiting around the corner. That\u2019s why it might make more sense to simplify your \u201crecession strategy\u201d by just calling it your strategy. Invest in digital transformation tools to change the way you work Change is hard. Some companies don\u2019t see the logic in dealing with outside change (recession) by making big changes inside (innovation). They want to avoid risk as much as possible by staying the course. But research shows high-performing companies understand that the best way to manage both risk and change is with a plan. A plan that\u2019s equal parts defense and offense. A plan that cuts spending and strategically invests. A plan that leverages the latest technology to help them speed back up once the slowdown is over. Research from McKinsey shows that in addition to clarifying goals and empowering their workforce, high-performing companies spent more money on collaboration technologies. According to the article, \u201cThese companies found that they could quickly shift the business model: in a matter of weeks, they routinely built new products and services or pivoted entire operations from in-person to remote, adapting to consumer preferences and practical reality\u2014all actions that might have taken a year in the before times.\u201d Even amid economic uncertainty, technological innovations continue to evolve. Artificial intelligence gets smarter every day. Networks grow and get stronger. And more companies are realizing that embracing new digital tools to help them work smarter is no longer considered a bold or risky move. It\u2019s become a necessity. A survey from PwC shows that: 53% of executives are increasing investments in digital transformation 48% of executives are increasing investments in customer experience 63% of businesses have changed or are planning to change processes to address labor shortage If you\u2019re still not convinced, here are some concrete examples of how digital transformation tools can encourage growth and build resiliency\u2026 1. They Reduce Waste Tough economic times usually mean slower sales and less cash flow. While companies race to find new and better ways to bring more revenue in, they can also save big by focusing on cutting the cost of inefficient operations. The right digital tools can help you locate and repair financial \u201cleaks.\u201d Tracking and measurement tools can identify where waste is occurring and help optimize processes to reduce or eliminate it. 2. They Improve Customer Experience Today\u2019s customers demand convenience. They want (and need) problems solved with a few clicks, swipes or scans. Every hoop or hurdle you put between them and a solution gives them an excuse to go somewhere else. Agent-assisted and self-guided digital workflows can help streamline the customer experience and create easy routes to a first-time fix. Visual customer service support can build empathy, improve communication and help grow trust. 3. They Increase Process Efficiency Year after year, companies strive to do what they do better. Faster. At a lower cost. With higher quality. Efficiency is the never-ending mission that can benefit most from new digital technologies. Process automation tools can boost productivity by eliminating time-consuming and repetitive tasks. Those built with AR and AI capabilities add even more value and help keep optimization a top priority. The trick here is to remember that the best automation solutions are powered by people. As stated by PwC, \u201cWithout the right talent, automations can fail to deliver on promised efficiencies and increase operational risk.\u201d The added bonus? Companies with leaner and more nimble operations have a distinct advantage once the economy settles. 4. They Boost Employee Satisfaction Nobody comes to work hoping to leave frustrated. Regardless of their title, people want to win at their job. They want to solve a customer problem, fix a faulty machine, or help someone file an insurance claim after an accident. Falling short feels terrible. Tools that help service teams solve problems faster do more than boost the bottom line. They give your workforce the satisfaction of a job well done\u2026 and a job done right the first time. It doesn\u2019t hurt that those tools also allow them to offer a more enhanced level of service, retain more mission-critical data and help more people in less time. 5. They Expose New Revenue Opportunities Digital innovation has the power to help you see what you do in a whole new light. One of the biggest trends for manufacturers is the idea of offering more than a product. Servitization prioritizes outcomes and performance over products. Instead of simply buying a piece of equipment, the customer engages in a long-term relationship with the manufacturer based on service and continued support. Digital innovation and the Internet of Things (IoT) are helping to make this a profitable shift for manufacturing companies around the world. 6. They Support Sustainability It\u2019s not enough to focus on results for the short term. Customers, employees and investors are counting on you to stick to long-term plans that keep future generations in mind. Even during a recession, companies need to stay committed to sustainability. We\u2019ve all experienced how digital transformation can immediately impact the environment. During the peak of the COVID-19 crisis, shutdowns across the globe led to improvements in air quality and reductions in water and noise pollution. With many employees working remotely from home, companies were forced to improvise using digital tools such as video conferencing and online collaboration software. Businesses have made their way back to normal, but new research shows that about one-third of work in the United States is still being done from home. And numbers from the UK indicate that 84% of workers forced to work from home because of coronavirus said they planned to stick with a hybrid work model for the future. And because so many companies relied on basic visual tools then, they\u2019ve been quick to see the value of video as part of a \u201cremote first\u201d strategy today. Much more advanced visual support tools are helping them elevate the capabilities of their customer service and field service operations. The remote-first approach also gives them an almost unfair advantage when it comes to meeting their sustainability goals. Work from Home (WFH) options reduce or eliminate employee commutes. Digital solutions don\u2019t waste paper. And fewer truck rolls mean less fuel usage and lower carbon emissions. Resilience is a Team Sport They say that the secret to success is just getting started. But sometimes building (and maintaining) momentum can be the hardest part. Digital transformation is not a magic bullet or a miracle diet. It\u2019s a process that needs to be built into the fabric of your company to ensure future growth. An article from McKinsey about major oil and gas companies showed that while most of them launched a digital transformation effort, as much as 70% of them haven\u2019t progressed past the pilot phase. What\u2019s stopping them from moving forward? Every company can probably come up with a million reasons why their digital innovation got stuck. But there\u2019s only one good reason to get unstuck: your company\u2019s future. Businesses who make it through the coming round of economic turbulence might not have much recovery time before the next wave hits. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), there were 122 completed recessions in 21 advanced economies between 1960 and 2007. That\u2019s a pretty steady diet of disruption. In 2019, Walter Frick wrote an article in the Harvard Business Review where he observed that \u201cRecessions can create wide and long-standing performance gaps between companies.\u201d He added, \u201cResearch has found that digital technology can do the same. Companies that have neglected digital transformation may find that the next recession makes those gaps insurmountable.\u201d You can see why preparing for tough times deserves top priority. And since none of us can go back to yesterday, starting today is the next best option.

While the world still waits patiently for the luxury of hover cars and shopping malls on the moon, medical facts are sounding more like science fiction every day. Artificial intelligence is predicting disease. Wearable devices monitor what happens inside our bodies. And robots are scrubbing in for surgery. But the healthcare industry\u2019s journey to a completely connected, digital future is a marathon, not a sprint. Modernization is a massive effort for hospitals and medical facilities around the world. While the C-suites do their best to launch digital revolutions, doctors and nurses still have to care for patients. Getting healthcare over the line is going to take a concerted effort from stakeholders at every level. That includes the talented technicians and expert engineers who keep all that life-saving equipment operational. Here are 7 insights about the future of healthcare, medical devices and technology and why they matter for service organizations. \u201c99% of survey respondents said that the development and commercialization of digital health solutions has accelerated in the past two years.\u201d Source: Accenture POV Digital Health & MedTech Why it Matters for Service There\u2019s no denying the obvious: healthcare and technology are officially a couple. When it comes to high-tech tipping points, the ship has sailed, the train has left the station\u2026 pick your analogy. Change is happening fast and if you haven\u2019t reserved your seat on the Digital Transformation Express, you may have to hustle to catch up. For those who\u2019ve been watching the slow-motion story of electronic health records (EHRs) since the 1960s and 70s, that was then. Today, seismic digital shifts in healthcare are happening over months rather than decades. The good news? It\u2019s easier than ever to get started on one solution at a time. The key is finding a tool that can grow with you and plays well with existing platforms. \u201cMore than 30 health systems have invested $2.5 billion in remote monitoring and home health, alongside an additional $1 billion to support digital capabilities \u2014 and that number is rising according to PwC\u2019s Hospital of the Future 2022 study.\u201d Source: PwC Pulse Survey January 2022 Why it Matters for Service If you needed proof that healthcare is going mobile, those numbers are in billions (with a B). For tech companies, manufacturers, and service organizations, the more value they can provide during this evolution, the better. The Care at Home shift is full of opportunity. A McKinsey report stated that the shift \u201ccould create value for payers, healthcare facilities and physician groups, Care at Home providers, technology companies, and investors. It also could improve patients\u2019 quality of care and experience.\u201d It\u2019s important to keep in mind that you\u2019ll probably have to adjust strategy when it comes to service. Not only do medical device manufacturers have to consider the new challenges that come with a surge in self-administered care, but they will need reliable and easy-to-use support channels for customers. \u201c60% of [healthcare] executives say digital transformation is their most critical growth driver.\u201d Source: PwC Pulse Survey January 2022 Why it Matters for Service This is nothing less than the complete rethinking of the way hospitals and healthcare facilities operate. But the good news is that the majority of healthcare leaders are moving forward with the patient experience in mind. According to a Deloitte survey, health systems are \u201ctaking a consumer-centered, outside-in approach\u2014designing processes and experiences from a consumer\u2019s perspective as a way to build their trust and loyalty\u2014to improve patient experience and build on newer forms of care delivery using digital technology.\u201d This is important for service organizations in the healthcare space because the more hospitals consider the patient experience, the more they become aware of their OWN customer experience. Are you making the repair process easier? Are you resolving issues faster? Are you delivering added value or just fixing what\u2019s broken? \u201cGlobal demand for healthcare workers is predicted to rise to 80 million staff by 2030. With supply of healthcare workers expected to reach just 65 million over the same period, this leaves a significant 15 million shortfall.\u201d Source: Philips Future Health Index Why it Matters for Service It\u2019s not great news, but healthcare is by no means alone in its labor woes. And like every other industry suffering a talent drought, one of top priorities is figuring out how to help current teams work smarter and not harder. Technology is a great lever to pull to immediately improve efficiency. Hospitals are busy, fast-paced workplaces that are full of labor-intensive, menial tasks ready to be replaced. Research cited in this GE Healthcare article noted that \u201cdoctors and nurses spend an average of 6 percent \u2013 9 percent of their morning and evening shifts searching for medical equipment.\u201d Service providers who go beyond the simple break-fix model can have a real impact on overall efficiency. There are countless ways to deliver added value with the right technology: Asset management Remote support and pre-visit triage Equipment performance analysis Compliance and regulatory support \u201cIn 2023 we will continue to see a rise of blended learning methods, combining the best of in-person training with self-directed online learning \u2013 from self-paced tutorials such as e-learning, webinars, and gamification to more advanced delivery methods, such as augmented reality and virtual reality.\u201d Source: Philips Healthcare Technology Trends for 2023 Why it Matters for Service Technology can do wonders in shortening the on-ramp from rookie to field-ready. Advancements in augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) allow new technicians the ability to learn, practice and make mistakes using digital twins and virtual models of multimillion dollar pieces of equipment. GE Healthcare has deployed a training solution that combines \u201cthe immersive power of simulation, the user engagement of cutting-edge gaming techniques, and the precision of a highly detailed technical service manual \u2013 and put it all in a mobile training center that can be shipped and used around the world.\u201d Even more practical are the \u201cmobile training centers\u201d that we all carry in our pocket. If you\u2019re looking for a powerful training tool, a remote expert guidance app is one of the fastest and most effective ways to get junior techs up to speed. \u201cHealthcare provider networks will increasingly look to MedTech manufacturers to deliver technological innovations to increase the efficiency of their staff by decreasing both administrative and labor burdens.\u201d Source: Iqvia, MedTech Trends to Watch in 2023 Why it Matters for Service While everyone is worrying about whether ChatGPT will take over humanity, it\u2019s important to remember that great technology can make our lives significantly easier. The ongoing digital transformation of healthcare is helping eliminate the busy work that bogs down medical professionals and can ultimately lead to better quality care. Service teams can be part of the solution by streamlining and digitizing as many repair processes as possible. Reduce friction by eliminating paper forms, complex spreadsheets and other roadblocks that keep you from getting those offline devices back up and running. \u201cExpenses for health systems are projected to rise by almost $135 billion in 2023 and about 30% of rural hospitals are in danger of closing.\u201d Source: Forbes, \u201cDigital Health Predictions\u201d Why it Matters for Service Money. On just about every healthcare CEO\u2019s list of priorities, you\u2019ll likely find cutting costs right below saving lives. The financial pressure is mounting and overwhelming, so you\u2019d better believe plenty of that stress will be passed along. How can you avoid getting crunched with the other numbers? The mandate for service organizations is simple: do it fast and do it right the first time. Maybe \u201csimple\u201d isn\u2019t the right word. But whenever you\u2019re ready to build a more efficient service process that leverages the latest technology, elevates the customer experience, and seamlessly connects with wherever the healthcare industry will be in 2033\u2026 we\u2019ll be here.

The definition of digital process automation (DPA) is the use of technology to optimize workflows by automating processes within them. Because those processes are more standardized, this results in improved enterprise performance and reduces errors that traditionally prevent businesses from achieving their best results. DPA is distinct from other forms of automation, making it a more attractive option for companies looking to enjoy the benefits of greater digitization, while also keeping human expertise and ingenuity at the center. For example, DPA is not the same as business process automation, which digitizes many day-to-day tasks, potentially replacing, rather than augmenting the work of people. It is also different from business process management, a more theoretical and research-based method of measuring, modeling, and automating enterprise functions. Digital process automation is straightforward, both in implementation and use. With DPA, technicians and experts have consistent, streamlined steps for task completion right at their fingertips, and customers have more rapid paths to receiving the help and services they count on. Adapting to evolving customer needs The ability to deliver world-class service is essential for companies to win an increasingly tight competition for business and loyalty. A recent report from experience management company Qualtrics framed the stakes in stark terms, with 80% of more than 20,000 respondents worldwide agreeing that customer service is in need of improvement. These customers, according to pollster Ipsos Mori, have come to demand \u201cflawless\u201d service encounters, with dramatic technological advances partly spurring such exacting expectations. Disappointing experiences, or customer service delivered with inconsistent quality, act as a drag on a business\u2019s reputation and revenue alike. Process automation helps differentiate a company\u2019s service offering, giving its customers the ability to show problems in real-time, while empowering technicians and experts to provide quick and actionable solutions. Added benefits include the prevention of unnecessary on-site visits, improvement of net promoter scores (NPS), and reduction in the number of product returns. DPA removes many barriers to optimal performance. SightCall Digital Flows raises service experiences to the next level by digitizing manual processes to improve efficiency and reduce manual error. With the help of standardized, step-by-step guidance, including detailed instructions and checklists, technicians and service workers can complete tasks with no ambiguity or confusion. Its flexible platform offers customizable use case creation, empowering customer service organizations to create and deploy flows built to improve processes across multiple lines of business. Companies will find several areas particularly suited for the implementation of DPA. Six benefits of digital process automation for customer service 1. Alleviate workforce pressures It is no secret that the labor market has grown tighter over the past few years, with U.S. employment levels in early 2021 estimated at nearly 9 million people less than the year before. Employers are competing for scarcer human resources, while many of their most skilled professionals are either seeking different opportunities or are no longer working altogether. Indeed, Pew Research Center suggests that since the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of older Americans leaving the workforce due to retirement has increased by two percentage points. There is also evidence that a number of positions remain unfilled because of a gap between the skills companies need and the ones current workers possess. As service professionals are hired to fill vacancies, these new hires often lack the acumen of their predecessors. Digitizing processes ensures universal access to essential information needed to complete tasks, relieving training pressures on companies and ensuring that knowledge is widely available to everyone in an organization. 2. Augment self-service resources Customer service teams spend a significant portion of their time assisting with routine matters that customers could or would like to handle on their own. With 40% of customers preferring self-service over expert assistance, DPA easily empowers them to complete complex procedures with the help of informative, on-screen instructions, powered by AI and AR technology. Providing self-service resources for customers to address common issues has the added benefit of freeing up service agents to focus on higher-value tasks. 3. Improve first-time fix rates First-time fix rates represent one of the most important key performance indicators for businesses to track to determine how effectively they are providing a service. Questions or product issues that require redundant steps put companies at a higher risk of losing business and customer loyalty. With digital process automation, customer service solutions are standardized and easily accessible to any service agent, so that a worker can complete a task with no follow-ups or additional dispatches needed. 4. Target and avoid problems before a site visit A company\u2019s ability to \u201ctriage\u201d an issue can reduce unnecessary steps on the path to issue resolution in multiple ways. Technicians can reduce average handling time by collecting essential information from the customer prior to the start of a virtual session or in-person dispatch. Appointments can be made more successful by guaranteeing that the correct parts, tools, and technicians with specific skills are sent to a site. Furthermore, with digital process automation, experts can validate and test customers\u2019 devices prior to conducting a visual assistance call, to determine whether the phone or tablet will be an effective communication medium. 5. Streamline traditionally complex processes Digital process automation removes the headache from processes like the filing of insurance claims. In this use case, policyholders can complete customizable web forms, furnish supporting photo or video evidence, and send off their claims quickly and easily. For issues like damage or warranty claims or follow-up sessions, a customer has the option to escalate to a visual assistance call, with all the information relevant to their case collected and ready for the remote expert to review. This cuts out the need for a customer to repeat their story multiple times to different people. When a customer expresses a strong preference to fix an issue on their own, DPA empowers them to resolve or report their own issues, even technically complex ones, with easy-to-follow on-screen guidance. 6. Improve regulatory compliance Regulatory compliance, while necessary, can prove a considerable expense for companies. Regulated industries face costly fines or lost productivity if procedures are not carefully followed. With digitized processes, workers can perform essential maintenance for continued operational efficiency with an audit trail of procedures ensuring compliance. DPA case study: Standardized repair services with Digital Flows In one example, a global third-party administrator (TPA) working closely with insurance companies, their adjusters and homeowners needed a standardized way to ensure that repair work was performed and inspected to exacting standards while working with a large network of independent contractors. The company offers customized managed repair, restoration, and mitigation through a large contractor network spanning nearly 2,000 locations. Offering a one-stop solution for securing high-quality repairs for property damage and restoration work meant the company earned a reputation among homeowners as one of the nation\u2019s most trusted names in the restoration industry. But having such a large number of contractors working under their umbrella meant that standardized repair processes were all but impossible to achieve without multiple inspections and redundancies. Besides the costs accrued by additional site visits and contract delays, safety and regulatory compliance issues also became a concern. Enter digital process automation, a tool that guides contractors anywhere in the network through specific inspection processes throughout a job, while also gathering all necessary information and documentation, including high-definition photos and videos. Using SightCall, they receive access to a digital flow through a text or email link or directly from within the CSM. A digital flow can be completed on any mobile device, with all relevant information and media uploaded directly to the case file. Customized flows are completed before the work begins, while the work is performed, and after the work is completed and handed off. When kicking off a project, a digital flow guides the contractor to record a video of the work site while describing the work needed. The contractor is then prompted to identify any safety concerns present. Selecting any of these triggers an action that immediately loops in the people needed to approve the work so it can move forward. A task is generated in the customer relationship management (CRM) software, notifying the relevant party to review the case file and associated media. During the repair process, SightCall Digital Flows can also be used to monitor the quality of the work. For instance, contractors are prompted to take videos with commentary about the work for each relevant room or area in the house. If any additional work needs are identified, they can be instantly sent directly to a supervisor of the project and an insurance adjuster for carrier approval. Digitizing the entire repair and inspection process means the TPA ensures all contractors within their network complete essential repair work that complies with universal quality and safety standards. Full and auditable documentation acts as a quality check, while also producing increased efficiency. For homeowners, who in many cases are interacting with the TPA and insurer after having faced damage from catastrophic events like fires and storms, repair projects are completed faster, with fewer errors, maximizing satisfaction. Being able to inspect and approve work remotely has already helped to reduce delays, as well as eliminate unnecessary site visits. Now, by empowering contractors to collect all the necessary information with digital process automation, even more time was saved by remotely viewing each work order that required attention. Digital process automation for corporate customers Businesses catering to corporate customers face their own unique pressures to respond to technological advances, as well as service and cost needs. Take the example of one of the world\u2019s biggest oil & gas companies, seeking to standardize maintenance and repair processes, including in remote and high-risk locations, while also improving audit compliance and reducing their carbon footprint. For much of its history, the need for highly specialized engineers meant numerous in-person site visits were needed, posing a distinct challenge for offshore oil rigs. As a result, deployment time was in a matter of weeks, instead of days. Prior to the introduction of SightCall Digital Flows, engineers used pen and paper to log their work, writing down what repairs and maintenance tasks they performed on a wide range of highly specialized equipment, then transferring those notes to the company\u2019s database at the end of long shifts. This came with considerable risk. The company once paid back nearly $1 million to one of its customers for a repair that was improperly documented, because the work couldn\u2019t be verified. Today, for every repair and maintenance task, a technician can access a specific digital flow on their mobile device. As they go through the automated process, they are prompted to enter all relevant information and collect helpful media, such as photos or videos. Engineers can scan a serial or model number, automatically capture display readings, perform accurate AR measurements, and document and confirm their work on the spot. Through digital process automation, the company achieved hundreds of thousands of dollars in reduced travel costs in just six months, with significant savings realized on every site visit. With other efficiency gains included, these figures are even higher. A better choice for next-generation customer service All over the world, companies are enduring significant pressures to maximize performance, while also lowering operational costs, boosting productivity, and reducing human error. On top of this, it is essential for businesses to have flexibility in the way they deliver service, agility to adapt to external disruptions like COVID-19, and accountability to industry standards, all of which legacy systems can fall short in delivering. Digital process automation is the best of both worlds for customer service, allowing enterprises to keep the technical and service skills of their best workers at the center, while also mitigating common challenges faced in day-to-day customer service that can drag operations down.

D igital process automation (DPA) is defined as the technology used to optimize manual workflows by automating and digitizing processes within them. Because those processes are more standardized with digital technology, this results in improved enterprise performance and reduces errors that traditionally prevent businesses from achieving their best results. Digital process automation in field service organizations can lead to standardization of work procedures, improved data collection, more efficient technicians, and better service outcomes. Field Service Workflows Field service workflows are complex, dependent upon high-quality management of customer assets and the most efficient use of human resources, particularly valuable technician time. Implementing digital process automation is not simply about replacing paperwork, but instead is a comprehensive approach that removes barriers, streamlines data collection, and implements standardized procedures through a decision tree model. Digital process automation is straightforward for field service enterprises, in both implementation and use. With it, field technicians and service experts have step-by-step guides for task completion at their fingertips at every appointment and site visit \u2013 including in situations without stable mobile or internet access. In short, it provides a pathway that allows companies to digitize the way they perform essential field processes today, for a stronger and more dynamic tomorrow. How DPA Can Transform Field Service Operations For both technicians and the customers they serve, field service involves multiple steps and touchpoints from start to finish. The path to completing a work order starts even before anyone is dispatched from the service provider\u2019s office or warehouse, with the collection of preliminary job information the technician needs to resolve the issue accurately and quickly. Sometimes, the situations or equipment involved may be more familiar to seasoned professionals, but less so to new technicians. Traditionally, a service technician might arrive at a job site to find that specialized equipment or expertise is needed, necessitating multiple site visits and added delays for an already anxious customer. Other risks exist along the path to issue resolution. Some companies\u2019 legacy systems involve pen and paper notetaking and recordkeeping, often meaning that technicians whose hands and brains are engaged in a repair or maintenance task need to periodically stop what they are doing to take manual notes, prolonging the site visit, or rely on their memory after an exhausting shift, a scenario ripe for costly mistakes. By contrast, SightCall\u2019s Digital Flows solution digitizes manual processes to improve efficiency and mitigate human error. With the help of standardized, step-by-step guidance, including detailed instructions and checklists, technicians and service workers can complete tasks without any ambiguity or confusion. For companies that need to place technicians in the field and on job sites as rapidly as possible, training processes also become more straightforward. Digital process automation provides new technicians, or workers needing to upskill, with an immersive and straightforward learning experience, identical to the field service situations they will encounter on a daily basis. DPA, BPA, BPM: What Difference do These Acronyms Make? DPA is distinct from other forms of automation, making it a more attractive option for companies looking to enjoy the benefits of greater digitization, while also keeping human expertise and ingenuity at the center. Many process automation terms are used in the same discussion, but it can be helpful to know the difference for sure. For example, DPA is not the same as business process automation, which digitizes many day-to-day tasks, potentially replacing, rather than augmenting, the work of people. It is also different from business process management, a more theoretical and research-based method of measuring, modeling, and automating enterprise functions. Benefits of Digital Process Automation for Field Service Automating technician workflows Implementing DPA means that companies can give technicians of all skill levels or familiarities with a particular situation the steps they need for timely, accurate, and efficient task completion, minimizing error, and maximizing enterprise resources. Reduce issue resolution time by digitizing processes In a number of ways, digital process automation can expedite issue resolution, contributing to higher first-time fix rates for companies, one of the most difficult key performance indicators to address. For example, service technicians can cut down average handling time by collecting the information they need from the customer prior to the start of a virtual session or in-person dispatch. Site visits can be made more successful by guaranteeing that the correct parts, tools, and technicians with certain skills are sent. And with DPA, experts can validate and test customers\u2019 devices prior to conducting a visual assistance call, to determine whether the phone or tablet will be an effective medium of communication. Improve regulatory compliance Regulatory compliance, while necessary, can prove a considerable expense for companies. Regulated industries face costly fines or lost productivity if procedures are not carefully followed. With digitized processes, workers can perform maintenance and repair while also leaving behind an audit trail of procedures that can be easily presented to regulators and inspectors. Improving site visits and reducing duplicate callouts With a more straightforward way to receive guidance in the field, several work orders that would have failed previously are instead successful, cutting down on the number of unnecessary on-site visits. For example, field service technicians have immediate access to remote experts and can receive live, AR-powered assistance to help them resolve complex tasks from any mobile or wearable device. New technicians or those in training also become more effective in the field, with data showing a 41% decrease in training time post-digitization. Call deflection and customer self-service Service organizations as a whole spend a significant portion of their time assisting customers with many routine tasks they could perform themselves. Indeed, the 40% of customers who prefer self-service over expert assistance can be guided through a work order with the help of informative, on-screen instructions, powered by AI and AR technology. Field service experiences tangibly become more rapid and effective, increasing their satisfaction, while also freeing up the customer service agent to focus on more complex or higher value tasks. With a self-service option more widely available, the number of necessary field dispatches decreases, allowing for greater cost savings and a smaller environmental footprint for the company. Target and avoid problems before a site visit The ability to \u201ctriage\u201d an issue can reduce unnecessary steps on the path to issue resolution in multiple ways. Appointments can be made more successful by guaranteeing that the correct parts, tools, and technicians with specific skills are sent to a site. Furthermore, with digital process automation, experts can validate and test customers\u2019 devices prior to conducting a visual assistance call, to determine whether the phone or tablet will be an effective communication medium. Simpler processes for high risk or high-value industries In another example of self-service options provided by digital process automation, warranty, and insurance claim processes can be streamlined by enabling customers to file with supporting photo or video evidence, allowing adjusters to process and close claims with both speed and accuracy. Remove complexity from internal tasks With DPA, complexity is removed from traditionally onerous activities with a high risk of costly error, like manual data entry. This means skilled technicians can handle more jobs remotely and work at their maximum potential, regardless of their level of experience or expertise. The company can then more effectively collect, share and deliver service knowledge across the organization. This valuable data can be subsequently stored and used for employee training and quality assurance, mitigating the potential damage caused by company experts retiring or leaving. Digital process automation also enables companies to easily construct custom forms to guide users and collect data, with embedded instructional photos and videos. And with the help of offline mode, all aspects of a Digital Flow can still be executed with data being stored locally until a connection is restored. Case Study 1: DPA Transforms Maintenance and Inspection of Offshore Oil Rigs For a global gas company, digital process automation revolutionized how technicians engaged with tasks in the field, including in remote locations with limited reception. For every repair and maintenance task, their technicians access a specific digital process on their mobile device. As techs go through the automated process, they are prompted to enter all relevant information and collect media, such as photos or videos. They can scan serial or model numbers, automatically capture display readings, perform accurate AR measurements, and document and confirm work on the spot. With the use of SightCall Digital Flows, a continuous internet connection isn\u2019t required to access the workflow steps, or to verify that information is correct. Technicians instead load a digital flow from any space with a connection, then head out to perform their tasks. Data collected in the field is cached and seamlessly uploaded directly into the correct case file when an internet connection is restored. Expected values are also available offline so that if a technician makes an unexpected entry, they will still receive a notification that it could be incorrect, allowing them to verify the expected value range and accuracy of their work. For the company, following a Digital Flow ensures that its technicians employ current best practices for every task, removing the need for continuous training that previously took between one to two hours away from a technician\u2019s productive time. Case Study 2: Process Automation Boosts Government Services In another example, a major insurance provider had a government contract for repair services. With a large number of contractors performing the repair work, previously without a unifying process, the insurer required a digital platform to ensure compliance with stringent quality and safety standards. Improperly performed work would produce extra site visits, rework costs, and steep penalties, and could potentially jeopardize the contract itself. Introducing Digital Flows fully digitized the overview and work process. Safety issues can be flagged immediately to trigger supervisor or adjuster approval for moving forward. And any contractor can access the Digital Flow with their mobile device, with all resulting information and media stored consistent with strict security protocols. For the insurance company, repair projects have been completed faster with fewer errors, safety concerns are registered right away and rapidly resolved, and all information, inspections, and videos are saved to a fully auditable system, eliminating the need for risk-prone manual entry. Case study 3: A One-stop Shop for Field Inspection and Repair A global third-party administrator (TPA) working closely with other insurers needed a standardized way to ensure that work was performed and inspected to exacting standards. When kicking off a project, a digital flow guides the contractor in the field to record a video of the work site while describing the work needed. A task is generated in the customer relationship management (CRM) software, notifying the relevant party to review the case file and associated media. During the repair itself, SightCall Digital Flows can also be used to monitor the quality of the work. For instance, contractors are prompted to take videos with commentary about the work for each relevant room or area in the house. If any additional work needs are identified, they can be instantly sent directly for carrier approval. Digitizing the entire process means all contractors within the TPA network complete repair work that complies with universal quality and safety standards. For homeowners, who in many cases are interacting with the TPA and insurer after having faced damage from catastrophic events like fires and storms, repair projects are completed faster, with fewer errors, thereby maximizing satisfaction. Learn how SightCall can Help Your Organization Implement Digital Process Automation Digitization is widely seen as a solution to many of the problems faced by companies across sectors, but this is only if the right approach is used. Technicians who engage with tools and technologies that are not straightforward to use and understand are less likely to be successful at realizing better field experiences. Process optimization, versus the overlaying of tools onto existing operations, is thus pivotal for success. And digital process automation is the vehicle for more effective and people-centered digitization. Get in touch with us today to request a SightCall demo.

Stories of how our product helped a business navigate through major pressures, succeed with higher expectations for customer service or achieve greater cost-effectiveness in their operations. We\u2019re willing to bet your business was attracted to Salesforce because it is the industry leader in CRM tools. You value the personalization and portability it carries throughout the lifecycle of a customer relationship. After all, to run a business without it is to lose money. The seamlessness of Salesforce makes your business run better, because you\u2019re spending less time on redundant administrative tasks and more time building, connecting and serving. Three users of SightCall will show you how this can be made even easier: Take a large auto manufacturer in Michigan. Its repair technicians, spread across North America, were stretched increasingly thin due to their workload and felt they struggled to maintain quality customer interaction with too many appointments. Meanwhile, company data pointed to a large number of issues that could be resolved through a virtual appointment. In this scenario, the technician helping the customer would not even need to be in the same city or state as the customer, freeing up local technicians to focus on responding to serious problems. A customer in Delaware, for example, sustained broken back glass on their SUV in an accident. The manufacturer shipped a replacement piece and sent a link via SMS for a video appointment, setup through their Salesforce portal, through SightCall. The customer received the new piece in one day, and on the same afternoon had a technician at headquarters in Michigan walk him through the installation step-by-step. The customer had trouble putting on the back glass during the session and wondered if it was the correct fit. So, the technician opted to verify a serial number to confirm the appropriate piece had been shipped. The customer waved the phone\u2019s camera over the serial number and let the Smart Optical Character Recognition tool do the rest, sending the information automatically to Salesforce and confirming the correct piece. In Atlanta, a Salesforce-linked primary care practice with multiple offices wanted to convert most patient appointments to telehealth due to the coronavirus pandemic, keeping in-person visits for only their sickest patients. This was a big change for patients and clinicians, and whatever solution the office chose needed the most up-to-date virtual assistance technology with high-definition audio and photo quality. The practice found that patients who were apprehensive or doubtful about a virtual visit \u2013 perhaps imagining the grainy or temperamental Skype or FaceTime calls they\u2019d had with loved ones \u2013 were floored by their experience with SightCall. The graphics and picture were flawless. Doctors could use both the front and back cameras of the patient\u2019s cell phone or tablet, virtually draw arrows or circles on areas of skin to point out a problem and use character recognition from the phone camera to look up medication or medical device information and provide real-time assistance to the patient. A global leader in the elevator and escalator industry aimed to convert the majority of technician work to remote assistance when it approached SightCall. Through Salesforce, it had established a centralized technical support help desk and trained its technicians to call the hotline number when they needed additional assistance on a job in the field. This was a resource-preserving alternative to a technician going out, encountering a problem and recruiting a second technician to help. The firm had a negative experience with its previous virtual assistance platform, which featured slow integration with Salesforce and inferior usability for technicians. By contrast, SightCall seamlessly integrated into the existing help desk, and cut the firm\u2019s callout rate by 19% in just six months. An IoT architect at the firm observed that its easy use created learning opportunities for new or less-experienced technicians, with an off-site expert walking them through a solution instead of having to call a second technician out to finish it for them. With less in-person site visits being made, the company also further reduced its carbon footprint. These are three stories of many. Among the large swatch of Salesforce users who have chosen to integrate with SightCall, customers have benefitted from huge jumps in first-time fix success rates, an average 69% decrease in issue resolution times and 30-point increases in their Net Promoter Score. Unique among products like it, SightCall appeals to customers with a global reach because of its compliance with data protection and privacy regulations like the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Businesses with existing customers in different countries and continents, or looking to expand all over the world, do not need to engage multiple virtual assistance programs when they use SightCall. If we could describe a differentiator for what we do, it would be to fight the perception that technology is scary and threatening. We see ourselves not as replacers of existing software or of people and their jobs, but augmenters of human creativity and ingenuity. We want people to be more successful and productive with the tools they already have. You\u2019ve heard their stories \u2013 now, what will yours be?

The dreaded D-word. Whether planned or unplanned, operational downtime of key equipment is costly if not resolved effectively and efficiently. Sometimes maintenance tasks can take longer than expected to diagnose and resolve, delaying operations and reducing productivity. Other times, hours and resources are wasted sending a field service technician out to a site to resolve a simple problem (or worse, to find that there was no problem at all). And issues that are not resolved quickly can lead to dissatisfied customers. Situations that lead to downtime will always require time to resolve. But with the right tools, repair and maintenance tasks can be streamlined to reduce days to hours and sometimes even minutes\u2026 saving you time, money, and customer relationships. One of these tools is AI-enhanced visual assistance, the core of the SightCall VISION platform for enterprise service organizations. What is AI-Enhanced Visual Assistance? AI-enhanced visual assistance tools add a visual component to typical customer service methods like call centers, chatbots, and email support. These visual tools allow field service technicians and customers to communicate information to remote experts visually, reducing the potential for misunderstandings from verbal descriptions of situations or solutions. They also can reduce the need for communication with an agent altogether, with multimodal generative AI capable of interpreting visual information from a field technician or customer (such as an image or video of broken equipment), combined with text prompts, to generate a solution to the problem. By integrating AI-enhanced visual assistance, customer service providers can elevate the customer and field service experiences by enabling faster problem solving. Five Ways AI-Enhanced Visual Assistance Speeds Up Repairs Real-Time Diagnostics Sometimes diagnosing a problem can be the most time-consuming part of the troubleshooting process. A customer may not have the expertise to quickly diagnose problems when issues with equipment come up, so they call your customer support team and attempt to describe the issue. When a solution cannot be achieved over the phone, they schedule a date for a technician to come out to the field, only for the technician to finally arrive and fix the problem in two minutes. The wasted time, travel, and costs associated with this process can be saved by giving your customers self-service, easy to follow visual instructions for independent repair. For example, a customer can receive a product specific link for a kitchen appliance when they upload a photo of the item or image of a barcode. If the customer needs more help, they can switch to visual support from an agent who already has the customer\u2019s appliance information in hand. WATCH: Visual AI & Self-Service with SightCall VISION Enhanced Context Between Experts and Field Technicians Field technicians know their stuff and are highly capable of addressing most problems when working onsite. But sometimes, even they need a little help from an expert. According to a 2023 Service Council report, when field service techs get stuck, 81% of them choose to \u201cphone a friend.\u201d With AI-enhanced visual assistance, those calls go beyond the standard phone call. Using two-way visual conversations, a field technician can provide a live video and audio feed of the issue they are working on. The expert can follow up with augmented reality guidance that the technician can see and follow along with in real time. Automated AI Documentation and Reporting Documentation. The other dreaded D-word. Oftentimes the most time-consuming part of a maintenance call are the administrative tasks that follow the actual work. Recording all the observations, diagnoses, solutions, maintenance actions, and final decisions in a report once a maintenance visit is complete can be tedious after hours (or days) spent working on site. According to the data from the Service Council, 52% of field techs say they spend too much time on paperwork. Multimodal generative AI can help reduce manual effort by automatically building reports from images, video, audio, and text compiled over the course of a given site visit. These reports can go as far as including annotated images, audio transcriptions, and detailed procedure notes, all automated using AI and eliminating the need for a field technician to manually create the documentation. Predictive Maintenance and Preemptive Repairs AI-enhanced visual assistance can help minimize downtime even before it happens, by providing automated visual guides for maintenance, repair, and installation. AI tools can analyze equipment to identify replacement parts and provide automated recommendations based on voice, image, and text diagnoses of situations. Field engineers and customers can use these tools to handle maintenance tasks without the need of remote expert engineers. And remote support with human-guided visual assistance is at the ready and can be called upon if needed for complex situations. Training and Skill Enhancement Knowledge is power. Empowering customers and field technicians through AI-facilitated visual training can help them tackle issues more confidently, competently, and efficiently, cutting down on time spent resolving problems and reducing the need to call for expert support. From sharing best practices to facilitating knowledge transfer within your organization, AI-enhanced visual assistance can help your service teams provide more robust support to your customers. READ OUR WHITE PAPER: How to Reduce the Field Service Talent Shortage with Visual Assistance and AI Future Outlook AI\u2019s evolution will be instrumental in promoting sustainable practices within the service industry. By optimizing maintenance schedules and extending equipment lifespan, AI will play a pivotal role in reducing environmental impact.

Establish your metrics early on, and be sure that they take into consideration any additional avoiding costs visual assistance might impact. Get the Whole Picture Visual assistance is commonly evaluated by measuring how many technical issues are solved remotely without an in-person visit. To determine the full benefit, however, means factoring in all the related cost savings of eliminating a truck roll including the hourly rate of technicians, mileage, fuel used, and the cost and maintenance of repair vehicles. Fewer truck rolls might also decrease the risk of fines or safety issues, so include that as well. You should also plan on measuring value through new revenue. Are you winning more business as a result of using visual assistance? Manufacturing leader Koenig & Bauer is solving up to 80% of service cases with remote maintenance. Looking Deeper at Increased Efficiency Visual assistance produces value not only by solving problems remotely but also by making necessary in-person repairs and inspections more efficient by ensuring the right person and parts are deployed to fix the problem in the least amount of time possible. Determining the value of remote support should also include information on first-time fix rates and how often additional or unneeded parts are ordered (parts wastage). Since deploying SightCall Fike has seen a 90% reduction in travel costs and a 70% decrease in customer response times. Make sure your KPIs fit with visual assistance (Think through your workflows) Because using visual assistance redefines common workflows, calculating the benefits sometimes requires a shift in how to define efficiency for agents, technicians, and their processes. Focusing on a single measurement of success such as average resolution time might skew your calculations. For example, in a Customer Service call center, adding remote visual assistance technology might increase the length of calls but decrease the number of repeat issues and product returns. Using live video to solve problems might take longer for agents but result in cost savings from reduced travel, parts wastage, and product returns. One of the most powerful tools you have in calculating and promoting the value of visual assistance is to talk directly to your end-users. This will give you insights into KPIs that reflect customer satisfaction and loyalty. Partner With Experts in Success At SightCall, our years of experience at the forefront of remote visual assistance has given us insights into how to capture a complete picture of the ways our clients and their customers benefit from implementing remote visual support.

This is a constant challenge considering the ever-increasing demand for state-of-the-art medical imaging equipment. How does a company meet expectations of innovation while simultaneously maintaining a high degree of profitability? For machinery that ranges from hundreds of thousands to several million, downtime is simply not an option. Research shows that an MRI machine can be down for 30-60 hours a year on average. If the average scan costs 2,000 USD and takes one hour to perform, providers are facing a loss of 60-120k annually per MRI machine. Malfunctioning equipment is a bottleneck to facilities and cost-generating centers, hitting their bottom line. In-home health care, properly functioning machinery can even mean the difference in life and death for some patients. Juggling Customer Expectations and Technological Advancements Emerging technologies and IoT advancements enable real-time condition monitoring and fault detection, empowering manufacturers to predict and diagnose issues like never before. While these advancements help, they are still partial solutions that must ultimately work in harmony with real technicians delivering repairs and support. As the technology powering medical devices becomes more intuitive, it has simultaneously become more complex. Now more than ever, it\u2019s costly to retain, hire and train technicians and engineers. Additionally, we live in an \u201cUberized\u201d society where customers are conditioned to immediate response times and fast service resolutions. Patients no longer have the tolerance for long wait times and are emboldened to switch care providers if service expectations are not met. All of this leaves healthcare providers with the task of having fast access to technicians that can keep a wide variety of devices operable and meet growing demands. At Field Service Medical, we spoke to service leaders about how they structure their engineering and technical teams to meet customer expectations and service demands in this rapidly changing environment. Their answers were varied, and the conclusion is that there is no one-size-fits-all solution, but it\u2019s an area that can use improvement. Providers and Healthcare organizations are looking for a solution, or combination, that will reduce downtime, improve first-time fix and increase customer satisfaction. The answer to their problem is easier than one might think; in fact, it\u2019s already in your pocket. Remote visual support, available through your mobile device, represents an opportunity for medical device manufacturers to differentiate, explore new revenue models, and improve marketability \u2013 all while reducing downtime. With SightCall, a remote expert can: guide the onsite operator in how to resolve a user or use error walk a technician through the repair remotely assess the issue and deploy a technician with the exact parts and instruction needed to effectively resolve the issue Let\u2019s take a look at how remote visual support can impact your organization. 1. AR-Powered Visual Assistance Reduces Downtime Without waiting for an onsite technician to arrive and diagnose a problem, operators receive immediate technical support through the SightCall app on their mobile devices. SightCall Visual Support allows the remote expert to view and assess the machine before determining the next steps. If the issue can be fixed by the operator, the remote expert is able to guide them through the process using a robust suite of AR tools including live pointer and document sharing. If the issue cannot be resolved, the remote expert is able to take video and photos of the issue, creating a thorough work order before dispatching a technician. During a trial with customers, Core Health & Fitness, the makers of Nautilus, Star Trac, StairMaster, and Schwinn, found that 55% of onsite technician visits were avoided by using SightCall Visual Support on the first call. 2. AR-Powered Visual Assistance Reduces Truck Rolls When a technician is dispatched onsite, there are times where they will face a complex or unknown situation that would traditionally require a second dispatch. Using SightCall as a stand-alone app or through a leading field service tool like SightCall for ServiceMax, they can contact their home office for expertise, or reach out to another technician in the field. Watching the live video through the back camera of the field technician\u2019s mobile device, the expert can assess the situation remotely, using tools like augmented reality, live pointer, and on-screen annotations to guide the technician through the repair. Airbus deployed SightCall on the final production line of the A330, and was able to reduce time to resolution by 60 minutes with SightCall Visual Support. 3. AR-Powered Visual Assistance Improves Technician Training Visual Assistance helps reduce the amount of overall training time that a new technician requires. With access to AR and remote visual support, technicians can be guided from their smartphone in new scenarios, receiving hands-on training while learning to become autonomous in the field. The onsite technician can be guided by AR, AI, and Remote Support, as well as training manuals and product documentation that can be shared within the video session. A study by The Service Council found that AR can reduce training time by 41%. 4. AR-Powered Visual Assistance Digitally Transforms Field Operations The ability to see and guide remotely aids in the digital transformation of companies seeking to centralize their workforce, capitalize on institutional knowledge, combat the field service hiring shortage, and ensure standardized processes. When companies\u2019 most skilled technicians can remotely assist on jobs from afar, they are able to spread their knowledge across the entire organization. This helps employers bring new hires up to speed more efficiently and make better use of relationships with third-party technicians. In addition to training humans, SightCall enables machine learning to help make your technicians more efficient. Images captured through video calls can be saved to the case file for future reference and training, and can also be fed into SightCall\u2019s AI for greater insights and predictions that will improve processes and downtime.

Remote support software enables companies to deliver virtual, platform-based video assistance to their customers, reducing barriers like location or time, as well as mitigating the impact of disruptions preventing travel to and from a service or job site. Remote support can be easily accessed through a customer\u2019s own mobile device, with or without an app download. It is typically one of several tools integrated within a company\u2019s digital suite and is greatly enhanced by the use of an interactive feature like augmented reality. How does augmented reality make remote support more powerful? The definition of augmented reality (AR) is the enhancement of an interactive, virtual component onto a real-world environment or situation, layering tools like informational text and 3D graphics on top of a user\u2019s field of vision. The use of AR tools has witnessed exponential growth over the past several years, with more than a billion global users projected in 2022 alone. Augmented reality capabilities maximize the potential of remote support to achieve rapid, accurate issue resolution in a wide variety of use cases. This article will explore its benefits in the manufacturing, energy and utilities, healthcare, and insurance sectors. Remote Support in Manufacturing In manufacturing, remote support can connect experts to a digitized environment where they can troubleshoot, train and resolve complex work orders. Supported by AR and artificial intelligence (AI) insights, they realize better resolution rates, less downtime, and improved customer satisfaction. Benefit #1: Create stronger customer assistance Manufacturers differentiate themselves through a modern approach to assisting customers with remote support. Immediate visual assistance can reduce service wait times from days to minutes, for example. Benefit #2: Enhance technician support Service teams are equipped with one-touch visual assistance through a mobile app or wearable, improving uptime and empowering them to accomplish tasks without the need for a return visit. Benefit #3: Perform data-driven maintenance Coupled with AI, augmented reality can help companies make informed decisions by identifying parts, diagnosing issues, and proposing data-based solutions. Benefit #4: Enable hands-on training Technicians can be trained through new repairs and complicated work orders on the job through visual assistance, navigating real-world examples they are likely to encounter later in their careers. Hands-on training can be further supplemented by wearables, encompassing a variety of versatile digital devices that are worn on the body, embedded or contained within clothing, and even tattooed onto skin. Handheld devices can be replaced by smart glasses, for example, freeing service experts to use their hands in complex, or risky work situations. Deloitte has called wearables a \u201cworkforce superpower.\u201d According to its research, technological advancements such as augmented reality (AR) are improving the viability and utility of wearables. Hardware like smart glasses are becoming, to quote the consulting firm, \u201csmaller, lighter and more affordable.\u201d As a result, they form an increasingly irreplaceable part of an enterprise\u2019s Internet of Things (IoT). In fact, one study even suggested that half of manufacturing companies around the world would embrace wearable technology by 2022. Whatever is used to access it, AR remote support blends the physical and digital worlds to create an environment that empowers workers to handle even the most intricate and challenging tasks. Case Study: Remote support transforms printer maintenance MacDermid Graphics Solutions, a leading global supplier of photopolymer printing solutions based in Atlanta, Georgia, delivers high-quality graphics to customers via a diverse array of packaging products. Its operations span North and South America, as well as several countries in Europe and the Asia-Pacific. MacDermid is widely known throughout the industry for its excellent customer service. Its teams provide day-to-day solutions on a variety of maintenance, repair, and process issues around the world. In recent years, the company has been focused on applying virtual solutions to further improve several key performance indicators (KPIs) on equipment maintenance, in order to bolster customer satisfaction and shorten resolution times. As with many companies, its interest in these tools increased at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. With service technicians\u2019 ability to fulfill maintenance and repair work orders on-site significantly curtailed, MacDermid had to balance keeping people safe while maintaining a hard-won reputation for customer care. It was essential to find a solution that would work on mobile devices but also enabled its people to use wearable technology like smart glasses. A primary objective was to permit technicians to be remotely guided through a task or repair process with the benefit of AR overlay, while still having both hands able to maneuver. Customers and technicians can launch SightCall remote support sessions through their own smartphones, providing and receiving crucial work order information in real-time thanks to Salesforce integration. Even in low-bandwidth environments, sessions benefit from guaranteed HD picture quality and reliable video. And tools like optical character recognition can accurately read and interpret data on a machine, even from a distance of several feet, and feed it directly back to the work order, with no manual entry required. When technicians have no other choice but to go on-site, they can have their hands free to do the work using smart glasses, while a remote expert walks them through it. Because of this, only a single tech needs to be dispatched to handle more complicated cases. The training of junior or less experienced workers has also been boosted by the immersive experience of the platform. After only a few months of deploying remote support, MacDermid Graphics Solutions realized a 20% truck roll reduction in the number of work orders that required sending a technician on-site. Customers were also guided through issues with their printers with the help of a remote expert, increasing first-time fix rates. Remote Support in Energy and Utilities Energy and utility organizations require proven technologies that can contend in rugged and volatile work environments. Remote support enables them to reduce equipment downtime with assistance that is secure, device-agnostic, and adaptable to changing network conditions. Benefit #1: Reduce downtime, improving profits The financial impact of equipment downtime can easily overwhelm companies, but remote support can enable them to identify and address technical issues faster than before. With a clear line of vision on issues in the field, service organizations can keep equipment online and reduce unnecessary truck rolls, providing increased profit margins and a key competitive differentiator. Benefit #2: Target first-time fix rates Visual assistance means technicians are never alone in the field. With AR and AI insights, they have a greater chance of a first-time fix. Benefit #3: Cut down on truck rolls The costs associated with dispatching technicians to remote job sites can be reduced, empowering local technicians to accomplish the tasks with all the background information they need for accurate completion. Case Study: Remote support essential for the standardization of offshore rig work Take the example of one of the world\u2019s biggest energy technology companies, seeking to standardize maintenance and repair processes, including in remote and high-risk locations, while also improving audit compliance and reducing their carbon footprint. For much of its history, the need for highly specialized engineers meant numerous in-person site visits were required, posing a distinct challenge for offshore oil rigs. As a result, deployment time was in a matter of weeks, instead of days. Engineers previously used pen and paper to log their work, writing down what repairs and maintenance tasks they performed on a wide range of highly specialized equipment, then transferring those notes to a database at the end of long shifts. This came with considerable risk. The company once paid back nearly $1 million to one of its customers for a repair that was improperly documented, because the work couldn\u2019t be verified. With remote support on repair and maintenance, a technician can access a specific Digital Flow on their mobile device. As they go through the automated process, they are prompted to enter all relevant information and collect helpful media, such as photos or videos. Engineers can scan a serial or model number, automatically capture display readings, perform accurate AR measurements, and document and confirm their work on the spot. The company subsequently achieved hundreds of thousands of dollars in reduced travel costs in just six months, with significant savings realized on every site visit. And with other efficiency gains included, these figures are even higher. Remote Support in Healthcare and Life Sciences Healthcare professionals use remote support tools to extend their reach beyond the walls of facilities, with the ability to care for patients wherever they are. Multi-party care interactions, plus a reduction in the number of necessary in-person visits, are among the benefits of this specific use case. For medical device manufacturers and clinic owners, the use of remote support with AR minimizes downtime for lifesaving diagnostic and treatment machines, enabling intelligent, intuitive repairs. Benefit #1: Meet patients where they are Two-way, AR-powered video chat allows patients to connect with providers from their own mobile device, facilitating timely, convenient, and contextual care. Benefit #2: Aid provider and technician productivity The use of augmented reality can increase clinical efficiencies by cutting down on the time, travel, and resources needed for office visits. On the maintenance and repair side, AR use can cut downtime for essential tools, saving providers time and money, maximizing technician time, and ensuring more patients get the diagnostic assessments they need when they need it. Benefit #3: Reduce the number of preventable admissions Avoidable hospital admissions can be minimized by using AR as an immersive patient education tool. Post-discharge, an augmented reality-powered platform can help coordinate care, perform evaluations and even improve medication adherence by enabling fast answers to questions. Benefit #4: Encourage improvements to patient outcomes Better outcomes can be achieved by keeping care teams engaged with patients, using AR to manage wellness proactively and preventatively. Case Study 1: Major hospital expands patient reach with AR-powered telehealth A major urban hospital network in the Midwest serves as a Level I Trauma Center and healthcare safety net for a metropolitan region of more than 2 million people. Its online patient portals hold more than 30,000 individual accounts, and the network is particularly committed to harnessing the latest technology to engage and care for vulnerable patient groups throughout the region. Administrators had wanted to launch telehealth and virtual physician visits for several years but felt unsuccessful in realizing an effective and fully integrated system all parties were on board with using. Previously, the hospital network tried several different platforms to manage its care advice line, along with the limited number of telemedicine calls they facilitated monthly. With each, it encountered complicated training and licensing systems and little to no integration with its Salesforce customer relationship management (CRM) software and online patient accounts. Some medical staff were also resistant to taking bigger steps toward virtual visits, having not seen anything that convinced them it was a tool to transform patient care. These factors worked against a larger rollout of remote solutions. By contrast, embracing AR-powered remote assistance, the hospital network could go live with nearly unlimited numbers of users in minimal time, as well as upscale call capacity on short notice.\u202fPhysicians and nurses appreciated the platform was device-agnostic, with high-definition picture quality and low-bandwidth requirements. With AR, they could guide patients through solutions to problems in real-time, using tools like annotation, screen sharing, and even remote activation of the patient\u2019s smartphone light. A live telehealth visit could take place at the same time the Salesforce patient portal was being navigated, without any interruption or screen changes. This meant the written patient assessment could be completed or in-person visits could be scheduled simultaneously with the virtual appointment. The hospital\u2019s adoption of augmented reality tools took hold just in time for the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in spring 2020. When the pandemic hit the Midwest, the network established a dynamic command center in a single day. An average of 80 telehealth calls per month exploded to 18,000 calls in April 2020 alone. While these numbers eventually peaked down with growing numbers of patients returning for in-person clinic visits, by fall 2020, the network still averaged about 8,000 calls each month. A virtual waiting room handled the increased volume of patients waiting for a provider if they were running slightly behind or needing to review records or test results. Case Study 2: More effective, connected management of chronic patient conditions 1 True Health is a healthcare company providing better information, engagement, and protection to patients with chronic care conditions. The company engages with patients almost entirely remotely, achieving better engagement between them and their healthcare practitioners. Through remote assistance with augmented reality, the result has been the improved health and wellness of underserved populations, such as senior citizens. The company created a Care Navigator role, where workers based out of call centers perform chronic care management through SightCall sessions launched with the click of a button in the patient file. With Medicare supporting virtual patient encounters every month, the company\u2019s Care Navigators track and follow up on care plans, disseminate health and wellness information, and link patients to doctors and specialists. This service is accessible to every patient, operating across a wide range of products, reception, and bandwidth levels with identical high call quality and HD picture. Backed by a platform well-suited for telehealth, chronic care patients benefit from easier access to care, without having to drive to a clinic, and can maintain a regular cadence with providers and stay on top of their health. Case Study 3: Repair and maintenance of diagnostic equipment simplified GE Healthcare, a global health technology company, specializes in the engineering and production of diagnostic machinery \u2013 including MRI, CT, and X-ray scanners. The company is constantly investigating innovative solutions with the goal of enhancing patient experiences and providing immediate repairs in order to put hospitals back on the path to saving lives. When troubleshooting an issue during a field maintenance visit was especially complicated, a field technician frequently mobilized one of their peers or a more senior technician to the job site, resulting in multiple trips and greater labor costs applied to a work order. This often caused the affected machinery to be out of use for a period of time while a solution was found, much to a clinician\u2019s detriment. From the standpoint of a radiology clinic or a specialist\u2019s office, a day \u2013 let alone longer \u2013 without an MRI scanner creates a significant functional barrier. Patient appointments must be delayed or canceled, and the scanner becomes unavailable in the event an emergency arises. GE needed to reduce any unnecessary downtime and ensure the equipment would be available in the moments that matter. The company\u2019s goal was to shorten the length of time on-site and improve first-time fix rates, reducing the need for multiple trips. When it decided to search for a visual assistance solution, one priority stood out: the highest possible call quality to facilitate real-time work order completion and a higher issue resolution rate. Today, GE Healthcare complements its field support solution with SightCall AR-powered visual assistance, drawn especially to its ease of scalability. Field technicians were impressed by the reliable video quality and consistent audio and video. They could carry out remote-guided repairs with greater ease and agility, thanks to touchless capabilities using the device of their choice. Site data, like product serial numbers, could be fed back to the work order with the smartphone camera simply held in front of the desired data to read it, with no manual entry required. GE Healthcare noticed an increase in several key performance indicators, most notably with improved resolution rates. Maintenance turnaround times were shortened to averages of six to eight hours, versus three days prior to the implementation of SightCall. With the average call taking only 40 minutes, the company estimates it has saved hundreds of thousands of dollars in travel costs. Remote Support in Insurance Replacing on-site adjuster visits with live video shortens the claim lifecycle, and even makes it possible for insurance policyholders to be reimbursed during their call. Using remote support means a policyholder can show damage in real-time, and file claims more efficiently. For their part, adjusters can handle claims remotely through a live stream, pausing live video feeds, highlighting key issues, and opening claim documentation on the customer\u2019s device. Remote support yields numerous specific benefits in this sector. Benefit #1: Shorten the claim lifecycle With the ability to file claims on the spot, the typically onerous claims process can shrink from months to days. Benefit #2: Cut down on supplemental costs Supplemental claims can become simpler by collecting better, higher-quality data over the live video stream. Benefit #3: Boost speed of customer payments Moving quickly and accurately through the claims process ensures that policyholders are made whole again much sooner after they sustain a loss. Case Study: Remote support revolutionizes repair and claim solutions In one example, a global third-party administrator (TPA) working closely with insurance companies, their adjusters and homeowners needed a standardized way to ensure that repair work was performed and inspected to exacting standards while working with a large network of independent contractors. The company offers customized managed repair, restoration, and mitigation through a large contractor network spanning nearly 2,000 locations. Offering a one-stop solution for securing high-quality repairs for property damage and restoration work meant the company earned a reputation among homeowners as one of the nation\u2019s most trusted names in the restoration industry. Nonetheless, having such a large number of contractors working under their umbrella meant standardized repair processes were all but impossible to achieve without multiple inspections and redundancies. Besides the costs accrued by additional site visits and contract delays, safety and regulatory compliance issues also became a concern. With remote support, they receive access to a Digital Flow through a text or email link or directly from within the CSM. A Digital Flow can be completed on any mobile device, with all relevant information and media uploaded directly to the case file. When kicking off a project, a Digital Flow guides the contractor to record a video of the work site while describing the work needed. The contractor is then prompted to identify any safety concerns present. Selecting any of these triggers an action that immediately loops in the people needed to approve the work so it can move forward. A task is generated in the CRM software, notifying the relevant party to review the case file and associated media. During the repair, remote support can also be used to monitor the quality of the work. For instance, contractors are prompted to take videos with commentary about the work for each relevant room or area in the house. If any additional work needs are identified, they can be instantly sent directly to a supervisor of the project and an insurance adjuster for carrier approval. Full and auditable documentation acts as a quality check, while also producing increased efficiency. For homeowners, who in many cases are interacting with the TPA and insurer after having faced damage from catastrophic events like fires and storms, repair projects are completed faster, with fewer errors, thereby maximizing satisfaction. Being able to inspect and approve work remotely has already helped to reduce delays, as well as eliminate unnecessary site visits. An Essential Component of Digital Transformation The question that many enterprises use to guide them as they consider this step along their digitization journey is: How could the business change if issues could be seen and resolved remotely? Remote support is particularly well-suited to closing access gaps that companies and their customers frequently grapple with, impacting cost, reputation, and customer loyalty, but there are a number of other sectors and use cases that it can be harnessed for.

Virtual assistance adoption expanded exponentially in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, as enterprises sought to respond to the current crisis or brace themselves for the next major disruption. In truth, the increased development of augmented reality (AR) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in nearly every industry imaginable has been a long time coming Take Gartner\u2019s annual Hype Cycle for the Digital Workplace, whichprojected in 2018 that chatbots and virtual assistance were 2-5 years away from mainstream adoption. The firm\u2019s research vice president stated that \u201cevent triggers\u201d would be one of the things that enhanced them, which turned out to be a perceptive observation. These \u201ctriggers\u201d are also known as inflection points, which Columbia professor Rita McGrath describes as incrementally \u201cgathering momentum until a transformative shift becomes clear.\u201d So, while none of this happened overnight, the time is now to become next-level by joining the virtual assistance revolution. You may already know what your inflection point, or catalyst, for embracing this technology is. Still, your expectations and target performance indicators must be highly specific to set you up for success. A few ideas stand out. We previously noted that 2021 could become a huge year for self-service, with companies capitalizing on trends toward the use of contract or \u201cgig\u201d work. Indeed, McKinsey predicted in 2018 that 50% of field service workers would be freelance by 2025. These workers can be deployed through the use of a customized, self-service app that guides them through a work order. For complicated tasks or difficult questions, round-the-clock expert assistance through a video call would only be a click away, ensuring maximum accessibility and portability, while also saving thousands of dollars in travel and other logistical costs. Perhaps you\u2019re using this year as an opportunity to hone in on the productivity of in-house workers. You\u2019re not alone: The Technology Services Industry Association (TISA) suggests the average technician utilization rate, or the amount of time spent on productive tasks that help a company\u2019s bottom line, hovers around 73%. Some manual tasks can be reduced with the right visual assistance solution. SightCall, for instance, features an optical character recognition (OCR) tool that can read data on a machine or device from even a few feet away and, with the benefit of collaborative integrations, can feed it straight back to the CRM into a work order or product search engine. This way, multiple steps and device toggling are pared down to a few clicks. Businesses that miss their inflection points entirely tend to disappear or become obsolete. Those who make a big bet trying to respond to it sometimes succeed \u2014 but often get caught in a state of constant reactivity. It is those who recognize small signs of change and prepare accordingly who are the best-positioned to take advantage of trends. It\u2019s why there is no reason for managers and business owners to avoid discussions about artificial intelligence (AR) and augmented reality (AI) any longer. Whichever specific solution will work for you, the time is now to begin planning, before gradually building trends and the next big event places your business squarely in the obsolete category.

Much of this growth can be attributed to the Uberization of our society, where ride-hailing and task-oriented service platforms are accessible through our smartphones. A recent McKinsey report found that knowledge-intensive industries, like field services, are one of the fastest-growing segments of the gig economy. With access to augmented reality, video assistance, and field service management tools, field service organizations are poised to engage the gig economy for field service excellence in the digital age. Field Service Expectations are Transforming Well-managed field services are crucial to the overall value of an organization\u2019s goods, services, and customer experience. The ability to dispatch a technician to install, troubleshoot or replace remote pieces of equipment is vital across a wide range of industries including telecoms and utilities. Today the resourcing and deployment of these field services have come under considerable pressure. Smartphones and the internet have created a cultural shift that is propelling us into a new age of expectation where: the customer demands a fast response time and extended service hours the employer requires workers with a higher level of skill due to the increasing rate of change in technology the employee expects a work environment with flexibility and choice All of this change puts huge pressure on service organizations, particularly where the marketing expectation is for an overall improvement in service and a reduction in cost. The Gig Economy has been hailed as a solution for these challenges, providing a flexible, low-cost resource for service organizations; however, there are a number of significant hurdles to clear before this can be considered the new resourcing model. What is the Gig Economy? The Gig Economy has traditionally been defined as a system where an employer hires skilled individuals to complete projects with a short duration. Following in the footsteps of organizations like Uber that have capitalized on available technology, this definition can be transformed and even scaled. In this post, we\u2019ll look at some of the benefits and challenges associated with the shift towards a Gig Technician model. We will also analyze how our industry-leading video assistance technology empowers freelance field service teams to optimize operational performance while helping enterprises deliver improved customer experience and control costs. Benefits of the Gig Economy for Field Services Customer demand has shifted over the past decade, driven by the willingness of the retail market to support a 24/7 service expectation. As a result, customers now expect to be able to report, troubleshoot and resolve service interruptions at any time, making traditional business hours obsolete. A field service organization with the ability to leverage local, on-demand, and skilled resources can meet these expectations, supporting extended Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for their customers. Traditionally, the ability to support a competitive SLA required a company to maintain a large field service organization nationwide. To support a 4-hour response time, you would likely need to have resources geographically dispersed. This 24/7 commitment can lead to overstaffing and a large financial burden. When leveraging the Gig Economy, even small organizations can maintain industry-leading service levels for their customer. If a service issue is raised, the company simply taps into local field service resources for the duration of the fault. This pay-per-task support model ensures a very efficient service assurance organization, mapped directly to specific service outages. In addition to saving on the overhead of full-time employees, studies show that customers will pay more for better service and that businesses are more likely to grow and retain customers when they provide a better experience. Tools and Systems for Empowering the Gig Economy A vast pool of highly skilled resources available on a pay-per-task model? This sounds like nirvana to a service assurance organization. It\u2019s true, the gig economy can solve a myriad of issues facing organizations today, but this model only works if a company is willing to undergo digital transformation. Consider that all technicians are considered to be an ambassador of the parent company, whether they are third party or not. If an Amazon package is damaged on delivery, the end customer complains directly to Amazon, not the local delivery driver. In the customer\u2019s eyes, Amazon is responsible for every detail of their order, including a successful delivery. In the same way, should a Gig Technician attend a site without the necessary skills and needed to provide service, their failure will reflect adversely on the parent company. To seamlessly and cost-efficiently integrate Gig Technicians into your workflow, cutting-edge technologies are a necessity. Workforce management software is one option, but it\u2019s often license-based and requires technicians to have their own credentials. This model can be financially unrealistic for organizations seeking to leverage the Gig Economy sourcing model. Couple this with the need to ensure security and guarantee data protection, and it is clear that providing the entire directory of Gig Technicians with access to a corporation\u2019s tools and systems is not feasible. So, how do you enable third-party technicians to represent your company, perform tasks accurately, and capture necessary data without connectivity to all of your technical resources? The answer is through SightCall\u2019s Live Visual Assistance platform. SightCall Bridges the Gap With SightCall, organizations can leverage their teams of internal experts to help guide a larger pool of gig technicians. This extends their level of technical excellence to the customer\u2019s site, speeding up fault resolutions and improving customer experience. Empowering Gig Technicians with the skills and knowledge of the company\u2019s experts enables them to perform installations, fault diagnosis, and resolution across a broader range of technologies. With visual guidance, they can perform tasks that are new or complex without having to arrange for another technician to visit the site. As a result, they may support a wide range of industries, increase their workstream, and ultimately grow their earning potential. So how does it work? First, an engineer or person onsite can use their smartphone or tablet to show the issue to a remote expert. The expert can then identify the issue and tools needed to handle the job and arrange for a Gig Technician to visit the site. Once onsite, the Gig Technician has the ability to contact the expert for remote guidance if needed. The expert can annotate on-screen, guide the Gig Technician and even share supporting documentation. The expert can also sign off on the finalized work, saving valuable data for future audit or reference. This hands-on interaction provides a higher standard of service, and the Gig Technician is never in the field without one-touch support from a home office. From the customer\u2019s perspective, their issue has been resolved quickly and the service restored. From the service organization\u2019s viewpoint, their SLA has been met without the need for a large field service organization. Using this technology, companies can deliver the same customer experience at a much lower price-point; even supporting field service requests across different geographies and time zones. Relatively low investment in a small number of highly skilled resources, alongside SightCall\u2019s Live Visual Assistance platform, provides true economy of scale. Previously we touched on customer privacy and how to gather data in a secure way. With SightCall, the Gig Technician\u2019s mobile device acts as a conduit, gathering the required data, photos, and other information from the remote job site. The central expert can guide the technician remotely using AR annotations or how-to guides, without leaving any proprietary or sensitive data on the technician\u2019s remote device. With simple integration into the industry-leading CRMs and ticketing systems, SightCall can be used to capture and process all necessary information, without the need to deploy applications or licenses to a remote field team. This saves on operating costs but also satisfies information security, particularly for GDPR compliance. SightCall is also cost-effective when considering the equipment that is usually deployed to an organization\u2019s field engineering resources, such as laptops, cameras, or other wearables. The technology is designed to work on any standard iOS or Android device which the Gig Technician will already own and removes the additional cost of equipment. Future Market Growth The gig economy is undoubtedly a crucial player in the future of Field Services. Flexibility, availability, and cost are driving the change, but there is also a pull from the labor market where people are actively seeking more independence in their careers. A study by Intuit predicted that by 2020, 40% of American workers alone would be independent contractors. Scaled globally, we are experiencing a true cultural shift in the workplace. In order to support this transition, organizations need to think differently about how they resource their field service operation, and also about how they will support this new engineering resource. And although this blog has been primarily focused on the field service engineer, this transition is just as relevant for the experts. Through the use of SightCall\u2019s Live Visual Assistance technology, subject matter experts can be home-based, providing remote technical assistance wherever it is required globally.

What is Digital Process Automation (DPA)? SightCall Digital Process Automation Overview Digital Process Automation (DPA) is a method of digitizing business processes by using software to automate and optimize common workflows that usually involve human interactions resulting in increased accuracy, efficiency, improved safety, and compliance. As service organizations are faced with increasing pressure to increase performance while lowering costs, the need to rapidly automate processes is a key part of a digital transformation strategy. Pen-and-paper approaches to business processes do not deliver the agility and accountability needed for modern service organizations. As a result, leading businesses in all industries are focused on digitizing their operations to increase efficiency while shifting to a modern and customer-centric approach. How Digital Process Automation Helps Service Organizations: Automate common processes for internal staff or customers Enables self-service capabilities for customers Standardizes processes across organizations and skillsets Ensures quality control and compliance Digitally transforms paper processes allowing process changes to reach the field instantly Improves on-the-job learning and knowledge transfer Increase the speed and efficiency of service technicians Digitizing Business Processes for Technicians and Customers With Digital Process Automation, visual step-by-step guidance is given to a customer or technician through their mobile device. Flows are customizable and can be built for a variety of use cases and to serve the needs of service organizations for any number of use cases, products, or repairs. For technicians, DPA streamlines procedures by offering manuals, maintenance instructions, inspection checklists, and more to standardize procedures, increase accuracy and efficiency, and ensure compliance and safety. For customers, DPA empowers them to perform self-maintenance, troubleshooting, product setup, and other routine tasks without call-center assistance or a technician visit. The Benefits of Digital Process Automation Increased Efficiency By automating hundreds to thousands of manual repetitive tasks within a service organization, technicians and agents are able to solve problems more quickly, with shorter handling time. Improving first-time fix rates means experts can focus on problems that utilize their skill sets. Cost Savings Increasing efficiency leads to cost savings. Digital process automation also results in increased accuracy of data entry. With fewer errors, there is a reduction in time to resolution, equipment downtime, and even parts wastage. Self-service options increase customer satisfaction, which reduces product returns and increases brand loyalty. Adaptability With digital process automation, enterprises can launch and scale new solutions, products, and processes quickly in response to market demands. Enterprise Use Cases for Digital Process Automation For both field and customer service organizations, Digital Process Automation offers a way to standardize and streamline common processes to save time and increase efficiency. New Product Activation Make your customers successful with self-guided product setup and activation, while collecting information for registration, warranties, or future outreach. Customer Onboarding Manual onboarding requires collecting a lot of information, processing documentation, setting up training or orientations, and other processes. When an onboarding experience is drawn out, customers can get frustrated. Warranty or Insurance Claim Streamline the claim process by enabling customers to file claims with supporting photo or video evidence. Call deflection / Self-Service Empower customers to resolve or report their own issues with easy-to-follow on-screen guidance. Pre-call Information Collection Sometimes, a customer will need to talk to an agent, but data can be collected before the agent joins the call. Reduce average handling time and scale contact center resources by collecting essential information prior to call start. Pre-visit Assessment By collecting all needed information through a Digital Flow before dispatch, you can ensure on-site visits are successful the first time. Ensuring the right technician, tools, and parts are sent out increases both efficiency and customer satisfaction. Asset Management Maintain compliance with validated step-by-step maintenance procedures and fully auditable records. Digital Process Automation for Customer Service Customer expectations are changing, and modern customers demand modern solutions. The rise of self-service options has empowered customers to solve problems by leveraging rich resources online to help them along. Businesses see the value of customer self-service too, saving time for their agents who no longer have to wait for a customer to find a serial number. Automating common processes for customers allows increased agility and the ability to scale on top of the immediate cost and time savings. Digital process automation can help you offer a variety of self-service options to your customers, from completely independent procedures to pre-call information collection. Finding the right balance of self-service options ensures that customers feel both empowered and supported. Total Self-Service DPA is used to present read-only information for end-users to help themselves with an option to escalate to a video call. Examples: Installation Instructions, Getting Started Guide, Troubleshooting Steps Self-Service with Optional Escalation In this situation, a call will occur but a customer is able to collect information via uploads or forms prior to a video call. Examples: Damage Claims, Warranty Claims, Repair Request, Post Call Follow Up Pre-Call Information Collection A customer is prompted to collect information according to predefined forms which will be reviewed by an expert and may result in a future call. Examples: Routine Inspection, Meter Readings Digital Process Automation for Field Service SightCall Digital Flows provides easy-to-follow instructions that make it possible for any technician, regardless of experience, to perform service tasks according to standardized procedures resulting in detailed documentation including photos and videos. With these standardized processes, the risk of mistakes and safety issues has been significantly reduced. Field Service Organizations benefit from having an auditable record of all repair and maintenance work performed, which in turn streamlines their invoicing processes and ensures compliance with all regulatory guidelines. Digital Process Automation In Action A leading energy company needed to standardize and create auditable reports for maintenance and repair tasks in remote, high-risk locations. Field technicians were previously using pen and paper to document repairs and maintenance tasks, then manually entering information into an FSM. Inconsistent information and a lack of documentation could result in unpaid invoices, regulatory fines, safety issues, and potential shutdowns. Using SightCall\u2019s Digital Flows Digital Process Automation on SightCall\u2019s AR-powered visual assistance platform, digital work procedures were created for all critical procedures. These processes can be updated with new information, and differentiated for specific equipment models, resulting in improved efficiency, increased technician satisfaction, and better quality control. Digital Process Automation and the Aging Workforce Many of today\u2019s skilled technicians are retiring from the workforce taking with them valuable knowledge. As technicians are hired to fill vacancies, new hires lack the same level of knowledge. Digitizing processes ensures all technicians have ready access to essential information to complete their tasks. Choosing the Right Digital Process Automation Platform SightCall Digital Flows is a process digitization solution that delivers visual step-by-step guidance to users on any mobile device. Technician procedures such as manuals, maintenance instructions, inspection checklists, and more are delivered as a Digital Flow resulting in increased accuracy, efficiency, improved safety, and compliance. A Digital Flow is fully auditable. Customer procedures can also be delivered via Digital Flow so customers perform self-maintenance, troubleshooting, product setup, and other routine tasks. SightCall Digital Flows empowers workers to complete their work more efficiently and confidently. Through carefully designed workflows, workers can be presented with essential information for their tasks and collect information in a convenient manner, reducing burdensome administrative tasks. In short, Digital Flows help people complete tasks more efficiently and accurately. Contact us for a free demo of SightCall Digital Flows for your digital process automation needs.

But times have changed. These days, modern businesses are literally on a mission to save the world. And sustainability has shifted from a \u201cnice to have\u201d to a top priority for C-level leaders. Companies investing in long-term transformation are looking above the bottom line to make sure the impact they have on the world is net-positive. This increased attention to environmental issues is a positive step. According to Google, searches related to climate change hit an all-time high this year. This means that businesses can no longer get by simply talking about their environmental, social and governance (ESG) initiatives\u2014now they need to show consumers, government officials, investors and others what they\u2019re doing to make a difference. The global community wants proof of action. Technology can go a long way in helping companies maintain their sustainability momentum. Visual assistance and digital process automation (DPA) technology are especially suited to help a business advance its sustainability goals. How exactly? By transforming the way companies do business with tools that improve efficiency, safety and accountability at every level. How do companies define sustainability? To be clear, corporate sustainability is about more than saving rainforests and preventing pollution. The scope of the current conversation can be overwhelming at times, but the general idea is to \u201cdo good and be better.\u201d Thinking beyond the dictionary definition, most companies talk about corporate sustainability in terms of these broad objectives: To drive responsible product innovations that minimize resource use and the company\u2019s footprint. Help protect the environment, on both a local and global scale. Connect with communities where people work and live. Empower workers to reach career aspirations, while also safeguarding their welfare. Promote and instill ethical and compliant behaviors across the organization and the value chain at large. Those goals are served by international frameworks such as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (or SDGs), which are a set of 17 objectives addressing issues such as poverty, inequality, climate change, and environmental degradation. While the SDGs may be considered the most well-known sustainability goals in the world today, they are not a reporting framework themselves. Instead, organizations like the UN Global Compact utilize them to fulfill their reporting obligations. For example, the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) is a set of international sustainability reporting standards that are the first of their kind. These include disclosures on a wide range of themes including energy consumption, diversity, and safety as well as numerous indicators. Any company utilizing GRI standards can increase transparency with all its stakeholders worldwide. GRI collaborates with governments to support smart sustainability policies and laws in every country. Again, while it may seem daunting, remember that this is a global effort. Companies all over the world are committing to the same standards, so you can always find comfort (and strength) in numbers. What questions should guide companies when refining their ESG policies? It\u2019s easy to accept sustainability goals in principle. In practice, because every initiative needs an understanding of current conditions, ESG efforts require effective and efficient data usage. To help define this data challenge, Deloitte researchers posed several guiding questions: Availability: How does a company obtain complete, reliable data? Management: How is data operationalized, so that a company can truly work with it? Transparency: How is the data reported \u2013 and what does it tell the company? Companies demonstrate their dedication to being responsible and having a positive impact on the environment by collecting and utilizing data more efficiently. For example, field service organizations can use visual assistance tools to elevate and quantify that data, which supports their ESG initiatives. What is the difference between sustainability and ESG? Sustainability includes a company\u2019s initiatives to limit their negative impact on the environment with the goal of meeting current needs without comprising future generations\u2019 ability to do the same. Sustainability standards are primarily fact-based, as opposed to ESG standards which gauge a company\u2019s compliance with ethical and social responsibility guidelines set by investment firms and other organizations. The ESG strategy focuses on company stakeholders, corporate identity and decision-making, as well as the board, C-suite or top executives, employees, shareholders, and others. According to research, firms with higher ESG indicators tend to have better ROE returns and lower risk. Investors utilize ESG data to identify investment prospects in businesses that have consistent long-term profitability but also meet social responsibility goals. \u201cSustainability strategies implemented at the corporate level can drive better financial performance through mediating factors\u2026 enhancing firm reputation, increasing stakeholder reciprocation, mitigating firm risk, and strengthening innovation capacity\u2026\u201d \u2013 Tensie Whelan, Ulrich Atz, Tracy Van Holt and Casey Clark, CF ESG and Financial Performance Report \u2013 Rockefeller Asset Management / NYU | Stern Center for Sustainable Business While ESG includes sustainability as one of its three pillars, it also encompasses broader social and corporate governance considerations. These frameworks typically set the metrics and elements that a company should disclose, in addition to the format and frequency of that reporting. However, they don\u2019t set targets for hard number goals like reducing carbon emissions. Standards and reporting Teams involved with sustainability and ESG projects focus on the following standards: PAS 2060: The only internationally recognized standard for carbon neutrality. It sets carbon measurement and reduction targets for organizations. It also allows an organization\u2019s carbon neutrality statement to be verified. ISO 14001: This is an internationally agreed standard that sets the requirements for an environmental management system. It has a stronger focus on integrating environmental issues into the strategic planning process of an organization. New changes in ISO 14001 emphasize digital documentation and reporting on environmental performance. In fact, in some jurisdictions like the United Kingdom, this kind of reporting has become legally required for companies. Businesses can use a strong data management framework to help them align with ESG principles while also enhancing revenue generation, regulatory compliance, and reporting capabilities. How can SightCall benefit your sustainability efforts? SightCall is a partner for businesses of all sizes and backgrounds. Our remote visual assistance and digital process automation solutions can improve operational efficiency to directly impact sustainability efforts. Clients deploying our solutions have increased machine uptime, reduced the time it takes to train new technicians, increased first-time fix rates, cut issue resolution times, and provided a more user-friendly experience. Companies using the SightCall platform have realized several key benefits in each component of an ESG strategy. Key Environmental Benefit (E): Carbon emissions When it comes to organizations reducing greenhouse gas emissions, decreasing truck rolls and technician callouts really packs a punch \u2013 and helps organizations striving to be net-zero, by reducing their Scope 3 emissions. Watch our free Quantifying Sustainability webinar for a deeper dive into the ways that SightCall helped Allianz, the world\u2019s largest insurance company, significantly reduce (and track) their carbon footprint. Key Safety Benefit (S): Reduction of dangerous and costly jobsite risks By connecting junior field technicians with experts at home base via AR, SightCall helps companies reduce the likelihood of accidents occurring and avoid costly fines for safety violations. Key Governance Benefit (G): Greater auditability All data from SightCall sessions are automatically appended into the system of record for a digital audit trail that ensures regulatory compliance and adherence to ever more ambitious industry standards. The result is access to a powerful platform that captures data at every step. Carbon reduction measures are also validated by documenting and verifying travel time and distances saved, making process costs even more efficient. The Sustainability Dashboard: Insights from Action and Proof of Progress SightCall\u2019s Sustainability Dashboard takes sustainability goals and translates them into measurable, trackable steps. How our Sustainability Dashboard works The Dashboard\u2019s data-driven insights empower service organizations to effectively communicate their carbon reduction impact on corporate sustainability objectives and KPIs. It leverages a sophisticated algorithm across multiple data points to determine the concrete savings to companies when they don\u2019t send experts on site. Metrics reported daily on the dashboard include: CO 2 savings Travel cost savings Travel distance avoided Travel time saved A CO 2 saving aggregate shows the total savings since the start of measurement. Companies can use this data to demonstrate the return on investment (ROI) of providing remote visual support and quantify their corporate sustainability initiatives. The time to embrace digitally driven change is now As harmful climate change continues to progress, the risk for companies is as much to their future viability and prosperity as the stability of our shared planet. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission estimated in September 2020 that for every 1 degree Celsius increase in temperature, there would be a 1.2% decline in annual GDP. And a year earlier, research from the IMF projected climate change would cause global economic output to tumble by as much as 7% by the year 2100 if left unchecked. Visual assistance technology will play a significant role in creating meaningful, quantifiable answers to otherwise daunting sustainability challenges, ones that will ensure field service organizations are as capable as anyone in reducing their impact on the environment and responding to heightened regulatory and consumer expectations. With the use of SightCall\u2019s solutions, businesses can see, assess and harness their ESG data to both accelerate corporate responsibility measures and bolster regulatory compliance.

What are Augmented Reality-Powered Visual Claims? Augmented Reality blends the physical and digital worlds by layering computer-generated images and text onto a user\u2019s view of the real world. Used in many ways within insurance including visual claims, damage estimates, explanation of insurance plans, and more, AR-powered claims technology provides an interactive, enhanced, and frictionless experience that drives efficiency, accuracy, and customer satisfaction. With AR-powered visual claims, onsite adjuster visits are replaced with live video sessions where the policyholder can show an adjuster damage in real-time so their claim can be filed quickly and efficiently without anyone having to travel to the policyholder\u2019s home. Adjusters can pause live video feeds, activate geolocation, take remote AR measurements, share documents, and collect any necessary signatures to satisfy the claim and expedite policyholder reimbursement. When integrated directly into your existing claims management system, you\u2019re able to save time, money, and resources. A recent report on the future of claims estimates that by 2025 more than 80% of auto claims and 50% of non-injury claims will be processed virtually. What are the Benefits of AR-Powered Visual Claims? Through using AR-powered visual claims, insurers can satisfy several critical measures: Improve Customer Satisfaction satisfied customers are 80% more likely to renew their policies than unsatisfied customers. With AR-powered visual claims, insurers can significantly shorten the claims lifecycle, provide faster support to customers when they need it most, and reduce unwanted travel to a policyholder\u2019s home, enhancing the customer experience and fostering loyalty. Lecari Group saw NPS increase from the mid-80s to over 90% with SightCall\u2019s visual claims solution. AXA Greece significantly reduced customer wait times with their MyAxaway Visual Claims App- powered by SightCall. As a result, AXA Greece\u2019s NPS rating increased op 85%. Reduce Expense Ratio as loss adjusters no longer need to travel to every policyholder\u2019s home to satisfy and fulfill a claim, unnecessary travel is drastically reduced which results in serious cost savings for the insurer. Now insurers can drive greater efficiency within their teams, as adjusters can support more customers in less time as well as have more time to focus on higher-value claims and policyholder accounts. Decrease Loss Ratio AR-powered visual claims allow insurers to collect better data and improve accuracy during both the underwriting and claims process. Features such as geolocation and OCR readings significantly reduce the likelihood of fraudulent or supplement claims. Improve Sustainable Business Outcomes As unnecessary travel to policyholders\u2019 homes is reduced, insurers can track and report on their reduction in travel and subsequent CO2 emissions. In less than a year of using SightCall, Allianz was able to process over 100,000 remote video claims and save their adjusters from driving over 6.3 million kilometers in unnecessary travel. With the average car within the EU emitting 107.8g/km of CO2, this reduced CO2 emissions of close to 680 million grams in less than 12 months for Allianz. \u201cThe insurance industry is constantly evolving its digital landscape, even more so now. The adoption of video expertise since its inception and the adoption of SightCall since its inception has allowed us to have total mastery and knowledge, generating a series of benefits for the supply chain and for our Group, even in a time of global emergency, including: the ability to operate without geographical limits and in total safety in every area of the entire national and international territory, as well as the containment of intervention time, settlement and the average cost of the claim\u201d \u2013 Giovanni Lercari Managing Director, Lercari Group What Features and Functionality Are Important to Insurers? With SightCall\u2019s AR-powered visual claims technology, insurers can tailor features to match their use case. Whether you are handling a property or motor claim with a customer or working through a repair with a craftsman, you can customize the SightCall experience to meet your company\u2019s needs. Flashlight \u2013 to accurately assess damage even in poorly lit locations AR-Measurement \u2013 to record real-world measurements directly to the policyholder\u2019s claim OCR Reading and Translations \u2013 to eliminate user error when collecting product information, and reduce fraud as the damaged product\u2019s make and model can be verified, no matter the language, and a like-for-like replacement quickly found Geolocate \u2013 to accurately confirm the location of the policyholder making the claim, reducing fraudulent and supplemental claims Live Signature Capture \u2013 allowing inspections or claims to be remotely signed-off, expediting policy premium details during the underwriting process, customer reimbursement during a claim, or for repair job sign-off How is AR-Powered Visual Assistance Being Used Within Insurance Today? Visual Claims Policyholders can now show damage in real-time and enable loss adjusters to assess damage remotely via the customer\u2019s mobile phone. If a picture can speak a thousand words, just think about what the power of video can do for the claims process. Adjusters can now collect clear images and live video footage for detailed assessments of a claim with an extremely high degree of accuracy. Video calls can be initiated through your website, mobile application, or chatbot and you can further minimize friction by employing an App free experience with WebRTC or No App Experience. Live video claims provide a faster, more efficient claims experience that allows claims to be resolved in hours, not days or weeks, and without anyone ever having to enter the policyholder\u2019s home. Did you know: Replacing a $200-$500 on-site visit and post-treatment with a live video session with the customer, can cut costs by up to 80%. Remote Inspections & Risk Visits Inspections during the underwriting and claims process can be carried out remotely without sending anyone to the policyholder\u2019s home or business site. This enables underwriters to accurately assess critical risk factors without needing to travel unnecessarily. Underwriters can provide accurate coverage on a policyholder\u2019s property for example, as well as outline any risk factors that need immediate attention from the homeowner. The underwriting process is more efficient, and the customer has a far more enhanced and tailored experience. Repair Quotes and Quality Control Quotes for repair work through partners or handymen during the claims process can be given in minutes and their work assessed remotely. Repair partners can visually see the damage so they can offer more precise and accurate quotations for repair work. This data can then be fed back into existing internal systems and used as a reference for other similar claims. If the claim cannot be cash-settled and goes through to the fulfillment phase, repair quotes can be given, and work assessed accurately by the insurer to avoid overpayment. Remote Sales and Subscriptions New customers looking to take out a policy can interact and engage with an insurer via a remote sales session where legal documentation and contracts can be shared, and the necessary digital signatures collected. Customers can interact visually with a provider, offering an added sense of security from the comfort of their own homes. Remote Assistance & Telehealth Remote assistance and telehealth enable policyholders to get access to the help they need whether at home, on the road, or during a trip abroad. If a policyholder has to access their health insurance on a trip abroad, they\u2019re now able to engage with their provider via a live telehealth session so that they can be assessed, and the next best course of action can be agreed on.

It was a simple, unfussy solution to connect two human beings. Do enterprise companies really need a Contact Center as a Service (CCaaS) solution to improve person-to-person communication? Why use a complex software platform, with layers and layers of cutting-edge technology to assist two people trying to solve a problem? Because it works. In today\u2019s digital world, speed and convenience are the king and queen of customer service. And nothing works faster, or easier, than a first-class CCaaS platform. More companies are learning that the journey from a traditional brick-and-mortar customer service department to a cutting-edge virtual contact center solution is transformative. The benefits of the right CCaaS solution can be massive. But that\u2019s only when (and if) an organization can understand how to leverage and adapt the many capabilities and features. What are Enterprise Call Center Solutions? Let\u2019s start with a simple definition. Enterprise call center solutions are comprehensive software platforms designed to handle high-volume customer interactions and streamline the operations of large-scale contact centers within an organization.

Wearable technology encompasses a variety of versatile digital devices that can be worn on the body, embedded or contained within clothing, and even tattooed onto the skin. The leading benefit for companies adopting wearable technology for their workers is straightforward, in that handheld devices are replaced by tools like smart glasses, freeing service experts to use their hands in complex or risky work situations. Deloitte has called wearable technology a \u201cworkforce superpower.\u201d According to the firm, technological advancements such as augmented reality (AR) are improving the viability and utility of wearables. Hardware, also called smart glasses and AR headsets, is becoming \u201csmaller, lighter, and more affordable.\u201d As a result, these devices form an increasingly irreplaceable part of an enterprise\u2019s Internet of Things (IoT). In fact, one study even suggested that half of manufacturing companies around the world would embrace wearable tech by 2022. With all this in mind, what are the benefits of incorporating AR wearable technology into service operations? Furthermore, how can companies decide on the most advanced wearable platform that gives them an edge? The rise in popularity of wearable technology In 2020, SightCall partnered with The Service Council to gain insight into the capabilities, needs, and desires of field service organizations all over the world. Our survey concluded that field service technicians overwhelmingly agreed that the products and equipment they work with on a regular basis had become more complex since they first began their careers. Customer and management demands have intensified, adding both mental and physical pressure to what is often a stressful job to begin with. Responding to these concerns, numerous companies are looking closely at tools that simplify technician processes, removing redundant steps from their work to create more time for the completion of productive tasks. The COVID-19 pandemic is expected to push wearable technology spending to nearly $82 billion in 2021 alone. For businesses joining this trend, specific reasons for turning to wearable devices include the ability to enable quicker and more immersive training experiences, a considerable benefit for time and cost-pressured companies bringing in new technicians, and even upskilling existing workers. Less experienced technicians and engineers can use a wearable to access AR and AI-powered visual assistance that guides them through new repairs and complicated work orders. Another reason is that these AR tools are also capable of creating safer environments on factory and warehouse floors. Given their ability to overlay pivotal information directly onto a worker\u2019s field of vision, the use of tools like smart glasses means less of a need for digital devices that are held, a feature that will be explored in greater detail below. What are the benefits of wearable technology? When it comes to technicians being able to rapidly and safely diagnose, inspect and resolve work orders in complex environments, while also using a platform with superior integration capabilities, products like RealWear and Vuzix provide an ideal answer. SightCall\u2019s integrations with these AR headset technologies turn the traditional field service model on its head, making expertise in the field available to the field remotely. RealWear is an industry leader for voice-operated headset computers and assisted reality wearable solutions to help people improve safety and increase productivity at work. Vuzix is a leading supplier of AR headsets or smart glasses and other products for the consumer and enterprise markets. The company\u2019s products include an array of personal display and wearable computing devices, offering users a portable, high-quality viewing experience, solutions for mobility, wearable displays, and AR. Hands-free software solutions enable businesses in sectors like energy, manufacturing, and automotive to gain instant knowledge with a remote mentor, document navigation, industrial internet of things (IoT) visualization, and digital workflow solutions, empowering and connecting their global workforce. The operational advantages for using both solutions are myriad. Here are eight of them. Benefit 1: A reduced paper trail More wearables mean a decreased need for paper. Important documentation like product manuals and documents are able to be shared through live video, allowing companies to both reduce their carbon footprint and bolster their record-keeping capabilities. Benefit 2: Hands-free Augmented Reality Capabilities Augmented reality (AR) powered visual assistance blends the physical and digital worlds to create an environment that empowers workers to handle even the most intricate and challenging tasks. Digital work instructions are placed onto real-world objects to provide the guidance and expertise needed to service critical equipment. Benefit 3: The added benefit of live, real-time AI insights Field service organizations can use artificial intelligence insights to enhance their workforce\u2019s skills and increase efficiency. For instance, deep-learning computer vision can aid field maintenance by identifying products and equipment, diagnosing problems, and disseminating feedback. From there, these insights can be processed in real-time with an AR headset or wearable device like RealWear or Vuzix. Benefit 4: Safer working environments Technicians handling dangerous, onerous, or heavy equipment, those working in high-pressure environments, or experts navigating remote locations can all be kept safer with their hands-free to engage with the world around them. Headsets provide a particular benefit when they are working by themselves versus with a team of technicians. Benefit 5: Reduction in job errors Besides eradicating paper checklists, wearable technologies place relevant information right in front of technicians, stopping workers from relying on memory. They can automatically log incidents and issues in real-time from their smart glasses. Benefit 6: Decreased training time Junior technicians can be brought up to speed quickly with immersive field training \u2013 and hands-free becomes even more hands-on. When wearing an AR headset, the student quickly becomes the apprentice and can learn how to make repairs by performing them with remote guidance. Benefit 7: Increased productivity Technicians using AR wearables are freed up to perform higher-value tasks, with the ability to digitally pull product information and repair history, access maintenance documentation, and obtain technical instructions allowing them to automate and streamline work orders. And with the addition of digital process automation (DPA) to provide step-by-step instructions for how to collect data and complete complex field service tasks, these benefits to productivity become even greater. Benefit 8: An ideal partner for digital process automation The definition of digital process automation is the use of technology to optimize workflows by automating processes within them. With the help of standardized, step-by-step guidance, including detailed instructions and checklists, technicians and service workers can complete tasks with no ambiguity or confusion. The path to completing a field service work order starts well before anyone is dispatched from the service provider\u2019s office or warehouse, with the collection of preliminary job information that the technician needs to resolve the issue accurately and quickly. And sometimes, the situations or equipment involved may be more familiar to seasoned professionals, but less so to new technicians. Service technicians might arrive at a job site to find that specialized equipment or expertise is needed, necessitating multiple site visits and added delays for an already anxious customer. Other risks exist along the path to issue resolution. Some legacy systems involve pen and paper note-taking and recordkeeping, which means that technicians whose hands are engaged in a repair or maintenance task need to periodically stop what they are doing to take manual notes, prolonging the site visit, or rely on their memory after an exhausting shift. This is a scenario ripe for costly mistakes. By contrast, digital process automation empowers technicians and experts to provide quick and actionable solutions. The result is improved enterprise performance and less errors that traditionally prevent businesses from achieving their best results. AR wearable technology goes even further in minimizing errors and drawing out automation\u2019s benefits, for more effective and safer resource use. Use cases for wearable technology Case study 1: Global mining company realizes more efficient field services A world-leading mining company provides essential equipment, systems, and solutions used by companies worldwide, extracting the fundamental minerals needed to develop modern infrastructure, technology, and consumer products. Supporting work in more than 140 countries, the company harnessed digital transformation to support service centers and manufacturing facilities all over the world, working toward greater sustainability, while providing exceptional customer service at the same time. Their goals were to minimize unplanned maintenance downtime while increasing safety for technicians working on powerful mining equipment. With SightCall providing AR-powered visual assistance, the company can now connect its on-site field technicians directly with experts in the factory, whether to troubleshoot, triage, or initiate repairs \u2013 all completed in a matter of minutes. During the support process, on-site technicians often need to have their hands free, and as such, SightCall\u2019s support for RealWear smart glasses was crucial. SightCall performs well on this assisted reality wearable device even in low bandwidth areas, which was a key requirement for technicians working from mining sites all over the world. The ability to store data from SightCall sessions directly into client case files in the company\u2019s Salesforce CRM, including troubleshooting steps or necessary replacement parts, also proved important to transform its service offering. With wearables and remote visual assistance, the manufacturer can more effectively deploy necessary expertise in any environment, giving instant help to their technicians and the mining clients and operations they support. And since the company implemented SightCall and its technology suite, the average resolution time for support has been reduced from two days to just two hours. \u201cBeing able to have a data analyst look at the machine in many cases provided an easy fix, saving hours of downtime. Using SightCall increases safety, sustainability and satisfaction while reducing risks and drastically reducing downtime.\u201d \u2013 Head of Service Operations Case study 2: A lifesaver in field services A leader in industrial safety equipment holds more than 75-years of experience offering customers all over the world specialized equipment in the areas of explosion protection, fire protection, and pressure relief. This company manufactures and services safety components for business-critical machines and processes. In the past, it had used a complex web of legacy systems necessitating expensive technician training, longer response times, and siloed data. Over the past few years, the company began its digital transformation with Salesforce\u2019s Customer 360, to streamline quoting processes and connecting data, before partnering with SightCall to launch a virtual field service system. With lives depending on its precise expert support, the company needed a robust visual assistance solution that could integrate seamlessly with its Salesforce systems and support processes remotely. During a two-month period of rapid prototyping, the company used a team of service engineers and technicians to walk through real scenarios and give feedback on what they needed to be successful to the engineers and design team. SightCall was deployed in just 48-hours, immediately increasing efficiency, cutting training times, and increasing both customer and technician satisfaction. As virtual support continues to evolve, the company is positioning itself to be at the cutting edge. The accuracy of AR measurements, with wearables for remote precision, allows for quoting new projects without the need for a truck roll. The company can also remotely train new workers or upskill existing technicians on-site, with the benefit of immersive learning experiences, and easily walk them through repair processes. Junior technicians can join a session alongside their senior counterparts, with both using wearables, to see best-in-class support in action. This enables the company to onboard and nurture internal talent in real-world settings while providing excellent service to their customers. Faster virtual processes and seamless data tracking have yielded benefits at every level, and across every aspect of the business. While all the above proved highly beneficial during the rapidly changing COVID-19 crisis over the past two years, the client has embraced these solutions as a long-term change, envisioning that remote field service will continue to be the norm across the company. Choosing the right partner Much in the same way Deloitte identified, wearable technology use yields a number of \u201csuperpower\u201d results. From more financially and environmentally efficient operations to safer and more effective workers, these are powerful tools to move enterprises forward. All these benefits, of course, are as much about the partner chosen as the technological features themselves. The SightCall-RealWear integration works with any Android-compatible wearable device, augmenting technicians with hands-free visual assistance that cuts costs and improves fix rates and accuracy.

Gone are the days of bulky, monochrome monitors, when people interacted with information through green words on a black screen. Today we live in a world of brilliant images, HD videos and visually stunning UX-enhanced design. Our smartphones can show us the world with a few finger taps. We can talk face-to-face with anyone in the world. As technology evolves, some businesses are still hesitant to embrace the visual revolution, opting for text-based communication or relying solely on automation and AI. However, those who have ventured into the realm of visual technology are redefining the customer experience in remarkable ways. That\u2019s because seeing (and being seen) is an advantage. It adds speed, clarity and confidence to every interaction. And there\u2019s hard scientific proof to back it up. Here\u2019s why visual technology adopters are revolutionizing the customer experience in enterprise contact centers: 1. Humans are Naturally Visual It\u2019s a well-known fact that humans are predominantly visual beings. Research suggests that somewhere between 80-90% of the information we perceive and process is through our sense of sight. Our innate preference for visual stimuli plays a crucial role in how customers interact with and perceive a brand. Visual support technology provides an opportunity for customer service organizations to connect with customers on a more personal level. When customers can see who they\u2019re dealing with, it adds a layer of personalization and engagement that words alone cannot achieve. They feel connected, heard and seen. 2. Visual Aids Enhance Learning Approximately 65% of people are visual learners. When faced with a product issue, customers often seek visual guidance, such as how-to videos on platforms like YouTube. Integrating visual elements, such as video tutorials or real-time video assistance, into customer service helps meet the preferences of visual learners, making information more accessible and understandable. When they are standing in front of a broken dryer, the last thing they want to do is pore over a thick paper manual or a monster PDF. They want to be shown how to fix the problem. They want to see a solution. 3. Visual Service is Efficient In the fast-paced world of customer service, time is of the essence. You\u2019ve always heard that \u201ca picture is worth a thousand words,\u201d but have you ever considered how that applies to customer experience? For busy contact center agents, the true value lies in efficiency. The average reading rate for adults is around 250 words a minute. If you want to communicate with 1000 words of text, it will take you 4 minutes. But a picture (or video) will get the conversation forward faster. Much faster. That\u2019s because the human brain processes images 60,000 times faster than text (minutes vs milliseconds)! Visual technology enables quicker comprehension and accelerated problem-solving, providing a significant advantage for busy contact center agents. 4. Visual Elements Improve Recall Back in grade school, if you were caught staring, you might be told to \u201cTake a picture; it will last longer.\u201d As it turns out, that comeback holds some scientific truth. Studies have shown that when text is accompanied by relevant images, recall improves by as much as 65%. Visual ticketing systems and troubleshooting guides in customer service contribute to longer retention of important information for both customers and service agents. It\u2019s not just about providing solutions but empowering customers with knowledge that lasts. It\u2019s like that old saying, \u201cGive someone a fish and feed them for a day. Teach them how to fish and feed them for life.\u201d The same applies to showing customers how to reset their routers, unclog dishwasher drains and jumpstart their coffee machines. 5. Visual Engagement Builds Trust Trust is the foundation of customer relations, and visual technology plays a pivotal role in building that trust. One of the biggest buzzwords in contact centers is \u201cempathy\u201d and nothing improves an agent\u2019s emotional IQ more than a face-to-face conversation. Humans are hardwired to respond to faces. Live video allows for real-time eye contact and the conveyance of sincerity through facial expressions. Faces resonate with humans, and a face-to-face conversation, even in a virtual setting, fosters a sense of trust and understanding between the customer and the service provider. As the service software landscape evolves, the core value of visual technology lies in its ability to humanize and enhance the customer experience. By expanding your organization\u2019s field of vision, you have the potential to create stronger, more meaningful connections with your customers. Embrace the visual revolution, and unlock a world of delightful customer experiences.

These go beyond simple first aid kits, thermometers, or even blood pressure machines, and instead range from at-home dialysis to continuous positive airway pressure or CPAP therapy and diagnostic devices. While convenience, the reduction of time and care access barriers, and better outcomes are all benefits that come with their use, it has traditionally been difficult for both clinicians and device manufacturers to provide responsive and high-quality visual assistance within the home to help patients onboard, manage or troubleshoot these devices. As a result, there is a clear need for augmented support through technologies like live video and digital process automation to assist in the med device field. In this piece, we examine how remote assistance powered by augmented reality can better manage the installation, troubleshooting, maintenance, or repair of medical equipment installed within the home. What is augmented reality? Augmented reality (AR) is the enhancement of an interactive, virtual component onto a real-world environment or situation, layering tools like informational text and 3D graphics atop a user\u2019s field of vision. The use of AR tools has witnessed exponential growth over the past several years, with more than a billion global users projected in 2022 alone. A variety of sectors, from insurance to manufacturing, have deployed augmented reality technology for the benefit of both workers and customers. Healthcare, of course, is another rapidly growing space for AR. PricewaterhouseCoopers produced research showing that its use in the sector produced a $35 billion boost to global GDP in 2021. The use of AR in healthcare spaces yields a number of benefits, due to AR\u2019s innate technological capabilities. These include: The ability to perform actions on mobile devices, and instantly receive relevant information with enriched real-world objects. Dropping digital AR tools onto objects in the real world, to show users how to perform tasks. Being guided in the field by a remote expert, even through complex troubleshooting issues, with the help of on-screen annotations. What are the benefits of using augmented reality for medical devices? Studies show that medical devices are not only used by patients themselves, but also by professional caregivers such as occupational therapists, nurse practitioners, and home health aides. Whatever training a patient or even a provider has to manage their own conditions and care plans, both small and large issues can arise when engaging a medical device, particularly if the tool is particularly technologically advanced or sophisticated. For patients especially, navigating paper manuals to learn to use or repair their devices can be impractical. When a device malfunctions, the patient may become frustrated or anxious, and unwilling to use it as a result. This may complicate the care plan prescribed by their medical team, and directly or indirectly contribute to worsened outcomes. There are a number of ways the use of an augmented reality tool can prevent or mitigate problems with at-home medical device use: Accelerate issue resolution and reduce downtime: When a patient engages with a customer service app, AR empowers experts to solve problems quickly and accurately. With access to AR work instructions and visual assistance, technicians are empowered to accomplish work orders. Using the platform remote triage also ensures that if a technician needs to be dispatched in particularly complicated circumstances, they will have the tools and knowledge that are needed to complete the task efficiently. Allow technicians to see what the patient sees, affording access to fast, personalized support that improves their experiences. Using an AR-powered visual assistance tool like SightCall is different from video conferencing software like Zoom or FaceTime. AR annotations mark the screen and provide instructions and action steps even to patients who are less comfortable using digital platforms. Document sharing capabilities also mean that both technicians and patients do not have to rely on paper manuals. And the highest levels of HIPAA compliance, plus GDPR and CCPA compatibility, keep all data confidential, with SightCall even able to blur faces during a session, giving the patient peace of mind. Using SightCall, medical device customers experience an average of: 81% improved first-time fix rates 69% decrease in resolution time 50% reductions in truck rolls, or the number of times someone needs to be dispatched to a site to solve a problem 41% decreased training or upskilling time for new patient support personnel Why should AR-powered visual assistance be used instead of FaceTime? As briefly described above, some providers or device retailers may be tempted to rely on free tools like FaceTime to connect or communicate with customers using at-home medical devices. FaceTime, Zoom, and others are ubiquitous, and even cohorts that are less acquainted with digital platforms may have heard of them. But their use comes with privacy risks and practical limitations. Most of these platforms do not benefit from robust data protection measures or end-to-end encryption capabilities. They also perform unsteadily in low-bandwidth conditions, making them unsuitable for situations where a patient support worker needs a clear visual picture of the problem a patient or their caregiver is facing. By contrast, there are several more benefits aside from the ones discussed above to using SightCall over a free tool: SightCall is built for engagement, and specifically designed to handle person-to-person interactions, where an expert is delivering information to another. Other video products in the market are designed for group collaboration, meaning they lack certain capabilities that are needed when dealing with technicians or patients. Connections are secure. Most video collaboration platforms are designed for anyone to enter with ease, which leaves gaps in security. SightCall delivers a targeted, encrypted meeting invite to users. No identifying data is stored on SightCall servers, and all users must accept terms and conditions for regulatory and compliance maintenance. Processes are integrated and custo mizable. SightCall\u2019s APIs allow for tight integration into a manufacturer\u2019s CRM, FSM, or custom ticketing system, and can be quickly deployed on either a pre-built integration or a customized app. SightCall can also be tailored to each specific healthcare use case, as requested by a manufacturer. In the case studies below, you can explore several companies\u2019 approaches to the use of AR-powered visual assistance for medical device management. Case Study 1: Apria\u2019s care is uninterrupted, despite a global pandemic Apria Healthcare is one of the nation\u2019s leading providers of home respiratory services and medical equipment including oxygen therapy, inhalation therapies, sleep apnea treatment, and negative pressure wound therapy. It operates more than 290 service locations throughout the U.S. and serves more than 2 million patients every year. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, people with respiratory conditions who already relied on regular care and functional medical equipment were now also incredibly vulnerable to complications of the virus. This made it critical for Apria to find a way to support its patients remotely \u2013 without entering their homes. In addition to regular patient check-ins, its respiratory therapist role also includes assisting patients with the setup and troubleshooting of equipment such as CPAP machines and ventilators. Previously, these had been installed and checked during in-person visits. Legislation passed during the pandemic allowed for healthcare providers to use video calling software like WhatsApp and FaceTime for a period of time. But these generic video calling platforms were not sustainable in the long term due to HIPAA and a lack of features beyond basic video. The right solution would support its existing workflow, as well as allow access from any device with full HIPAA compliance. It would eliminate barriers for therapists and patients using different mobile devices or, in some cases, home computers. The platform the company embraced also needed to integrate with the client\u2019s existing systems, including multiple legacy applications with Salesforce Cloud. Apria was able to quickly deploy SightCall for Salesforce, and onboard a group of respiratory therapists to help patients set up and monitor their respiratory machines at home. This ensured their care continued without endangering high-risk groups with in-person appointments. Patients joined a video session from an SMS text message, email link, or WebRTC. SightCall works seamlessly alongside the Aprialink application in Salesforce, allowing the therapists to initiate video sessions directly from the case file with all the patients\u2019 information on hand. They can record data from the call, including machine readings, directly back into the file. During a SightCall session, the clinical and logistics staff use tools like AR annotations to illustrate steps needed to set up or troubleshoot the patients\u2019 home devices. Through the use of optical character recognition, respiratory therapists can scan barcodes or labels without manual input, all while communicating directly through reliable live video. Since deploying SightCall, feedback from both the respiratory therapists and patients has been overwhelmingly positive. Patients have enjoyed getting to interact with their therapists regularly, increasing trust and satisfaction. Supporting them to set up and monitor equipment at home reduces delays or issues that could have serious clinical consequences. Case Study 2: Healthier dialysis patients with B. Braun\u2019s virtual assistance B. Braun is a German medical and pharmaceutical device company and leader in infusion therapy and pain management. The company develops, manufactures, and markets innovative medical products and services to the healthcare industry. B.Braun has more than 63,000 employees globally and operates in more than 60 countries. Around 80,000 people in Germany currently depend on dialysis due to kidney failure. Patients must undergo lengthy treatments at least three times a week, in centers that can be far from home. This type of treatment complicates the life of the patient. It also takes away from their ability to work and spend time with family. And while home therapies are an option, few patients use them in practice, apprehensive about operating the medical machinery without the help of medical professionals. To respond to these concerns, B.Braun developed a new home service that empowers patients to receive kidney therapy from the comfort of their homes. Patients receive a tablet pre-loaded with SightCall visual assistance integrated into Salesforce Lightning. With a single click, they can reach a medical provider with immediate access to the patient\u2019s Salesforce case history. The provider uses SightCall to see the patient\u2019s problem and guide them remotely through treatment. Patients who dialysate themselves achieve better treatment results, have fewer complications, and appear overall healthier, physically and mentally. In addition, successful home dialysis not only offers benefits to the well-being of the patient but also brings economic benefits and relieves our health system. Case Study 3: Major hospital expands patient reach with AR-powered telehealth Augmented reality can also benefit healthcare systems aiming to reach underserved or distant patients. For instance, a major urban hospital network features two teaching hospitals with 4,000 employees and 625 medical staff. Among all its facilities, it averages more than 3,000 births and 80,000 emergency department visits annually. Additionally, its online patient portals hold more than 30,000 individual accounts, and the network is particularly committed to harnessing the latest technology to engage and care for vulnerable patient groups throughout the region. Administrators had wanted to launch telehealth and virtual physician visits for several years but felt unsuccessful in realizing an effective and fully-integrated system all parties were on board with using. Previously, the hospital network tried several different platforms to manage its care advice line, along with the limited number of telemedicine calls they facilitated monthly. With each, it encountered complicated training and licensing systems and little to no integration with its Salesforce CRM software and online patient accounts. Some medical staff were also resistant to taking bigger steps toward virtual visits, acknowledging additional digitization as a strong idea in theory, but having not seen anything that convinced them it was a platform to transform patient care. These factors worked against a larger rollout of remote solutions. The client\u2019s patient advice line fielded a few hundred calls a week, while telehealth calls hovered around 80 a month. Meanwhile, its long-term vision of strategically employing digital data to reach vulnerable patients and address health disparities in the region was restricted by the limited tracking systems of the platforms it used. Embracing augmented reality-powered visual assistance, the hospital network was drawn to the seamless integration with its existing Salesforce Health Cloud system. The network\u2019s IT specialists valued the ability to go live with nearly unlimited numbers of users in minimal time, as well as upscale call capacity at short notice. Physicians and nurses appreciated the platform was device-agnostic, with high-definition picture quality and low-bandwidth requirements. With AR, they could guide patients through solutions to problems in real-time, using tools like annotation, screen sharing, and remote activation of the patient\u2019s smartphone light. A live telehealth visit could take place at the same time the Salesforce patient portal was being navigated, without any interruption or screen changes. This meant the written patient assessment could be completed or in-person visits could be scheduled simultaneously with the virtual appointment. Alternatively, data could be extracted from the call and fed back to the Salesforce platform, with no manual entry required, using optical character recognition. In fact, the hospital\u2019s adoption of augmented reality tools took hold just in time for the onset of COVID-19 in spring 2020. When the pandemic hit the Midwest, the network established a dynamic command center in a single day. An average of 80 telehealth calls a month exploded to 18,000 calls in April 2020 alone. Create easier, faster and safer care experiences The use of AR-powered visual support allows patients to become more confident participants in the care that keeps them healthy and safe \u2013 whenever and wherever they are. SightCall\u2019s enterprise-grade visual support platform harnesses the power of AR to allow both patients and the support workers who serve them to operate at maximum, regardless of their experience levels with a device or expertise.

The definition of customer service automation (CSA) is a process by which human involvement in customer questions and troubleshooting issues is reduced or supplemented by technology. CSA can save time, improve company resource use, and make customers feel more confident and empowered to resolve simple problems and more meaningfully engage with the appliances, tools, and equipment that power their lives. Embracing customer service automation now is a timely response to a number of customer experience (CX) trends that have accelerated over the last several years. For example, research compiled by Forrester suggests that between 10% to 20% of American adults engaged with new digital touchpoints in 2020, such as by paying bills online or ordering food or groceries using a mobile app. From a customer\u2019s perspective, these platforms are often the most efficient way to arrive at a solution, and as a result, companies can meet them where they are by embracing greater digitization of their processes. And for the businesses that serve them, customer service automation can drive productivity gains among teams, reduce or eliminate human error, and ensure consistency on a case-by-case basis. From implementing a straightforward self-service support option to positioning customer service automation within a broader digital process automation (DPA) framework, there are numerous ways businesses can harness this crucial component of the digital journey. What are the benefits of implementing customer service automation? Customer service experiences are traditionally characterized by built-in delays and complications, many of which are universally familiar. Time-consuming efforts to look up the right answer to a problem in manual databases, the need to dispatch multiple experts to a job site to make a diagnosis or resolve a problem, or time spent on hold as call centers patch a customer from one service provider to the next, can all act as a drag on optimal performance and satisfaction. Increasing digitization and accompanying expectations of immediacy in service sectors is the direction for enterprises whether or not they face external disruptions like distribution issues, pandemic-related travel constraints, and more. Because automation both creates standardized processes and allows algorithm-led platforms to seamlessly direct customers to solutions, a new pathway is opened for resolving simple issues and allowing service providers to devote their focus to only the most complicated inquiries. With digital systems like SightCall, customers are given the ability to show their problems in real-time and obtain fast, actionable solutions. This helps to maximize the effectiveness and impact of service departments. With remote visual assistance added to the digital service suite, customers can be further engaged and supported, with self-service sessions able to be rapidly escalated to a live video support session. Data the agent needs to provide an informed answer has already been collected during the self-service session, preventing any need for a customer to recite the details of their inquiry or issue to multiple members of the team. There are several examples of automated and digitized customer service benefits in practice. Maximum convenience for the customer With people regularly on the go and facing tight schedules, or with many businesses located at a geographical distance to where a problem arises, service automation delivers first-rate outcomes at a customer\u2019s convenience, effectively meeting them where and when they want. An automated option effectively yields access to essential information and issue resolution 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. This is easily integrated with an after-hours service powered by service professionals who can organize in-person service visits for emergencies. Empower self-service, even as a first step Many issues are simple enough to be resolved by the customer themselves when accurate and easy-to-understand guidance is provided to them. Automated self-service is particularly beneficial for household equipment like washing machines, dishwashers, or heaters, where excessive downtime can produce significant frustration. But self-service tools that also provide an option for visual assistance allow for easy remote assessment that ensures companies dispatch the precise tools and expertise needed for a successful visit \u2013 the first time. Closer customer connections with better outcomes The level of confidence that customers gain in knowing they were instrumental to the resolution of an issue should not be underestimated. Providing faster access to support helps to educate customers, which in turn can go a long way toward increasing loyalty and retention. Enable successful platform integrations and maximum connectivity For a company to include an automation solution alongside their entire service suite, a seamless, omnichannel integration is needed. Customers should be able to connect through whichever medium works best for their problem when a situation arises. Similarly, service organizations should have their visual support platforms integrated into their CRM or FSM so that their employees can quickly answer and respond to customer concerns from within the business systems that they use on a daily basis. Reduction in the number of product return Both product returns and technician dispatches can incur significant expenses for organizations. Automation, especially when backed by augmented reality support and artificial intelligence (AI) insights, can help avoid needless returns or redundant truck rolls through faster, more accurate, and more streamlined issue diagnostics. What are the challenges of customer service automation? Customer service automation is not a standalone answer to improve experiences. It also has to exist within, not only alongside, a broader capabilities suite. Automated self-service, for example, will not be suitable for every circumstance, because, at present, companies will only be able to program their algorithms to respond to a certain number of prompts in a certain number of ways. There will also be times that concerned customers want a voice-to-voice interaction where a diagnosis or solution is explained to them. While elements of automation are strongly beneficial for companies, service providers are rightly concerned about the risks involved in removing the \u201chuman element\u201d for both customers and the workers that serve them. However, digital process automation (DPA) is one answer, balancing technological sophistication with the human element that is essential for most cases. Digital process automation and customer service Digital process automation harnesses technology to standardize workflows, improve performance and mitigate errors that traditionally hold essential business processes back. It boosts the work of technicians and connection with customers. SightCall\u2019s own digital process automation solution, Digital Flows, raises service experiences to the next level by digitizing manual processes to improve efficiency and reduce manual error. Standardized, step-by-step guidance, including detailed instructions and checklists, helps technicians and customers navigate tasks and work orders with no ambiguity or confusion. Customers can be empowered to complete complex procedures with the help of informative, on-screen instructions, powered by AI and AR technology. How digital process automation works Digital process automation has helped completely transform once onerous processes like the filing of insurance claims. Policyholders can complete customizable web forms, furnish supporting photo or video evidence, and send off their claims quickly and easily. In one example, a global third-party administrator (TPA) working closely with insurance companies, their adjusters and homeowners needed a standardized way to ensure that repair work was performed and inspected to exacting standards while working with a large network of independent contractors. This company offers customized managed repair, restoration, and mitigation through a large contractor network spanning nearly 2,000 locations. Providing a one-stop solution for securing high-quality repairs for property damage and restoration work meant the company earned a reputation among homeowners as one of the nation\u2019s most trusted names in the restoration industry. Nonetheless, such a large number of contractors working under their umbrella meant standardized repair processes were all but impossible to achieve without multiple inspections, additional site visits, contract delays, and safety and regulatory compliance issues all arising. By contrast, with digital process automation, contractors throughout the network receive guidance for specific inspection processes, while also gathering all necessary documentation digitally. Through the SightCall platform, they get a text or email link to a Digital Flow, which can be completed on any mobile device regardless of wireless connectivity. Customized flows are completed before the work begins, while the work is performed, and after the work is completed and handed off. During the repair process, SightCall Digital Flows can also be used to monitor the quality of the work. For instance, contractors are prompted to take videos with commentary about the work for each relevant room or area in the house. If any additional work needs are identified, they can be instantly sent directly to a project supervisor and an insurance adjuster for carrier approval. Benefits of digital process automation in practice Digitally automating the entire repair and inspection process means the third-party administrator ensures all contractors within their network complete essential repair work that complies with universal quality and safety standards. Full and auditable documentation acts as a quality check, while also producing increased efficiency. For homeowners, who in many cases are interacting with the TPA and insurer after having faced damage from catastrophic events like fires and storms, repair projects are completed faster, with fewer errors, maximizing satisfaction. Examples of customer service automation Case Study 1: Insurance assures more efficient and consistent outcomes The world\u2019s largest insurance company, Allianz, has more than 85 million policyholders in property and casualty insurance, life and health insurance, and asset management across the globe. Always at the cutting edge, the company sought a way to digitally transform its entire claims process, transforming a traditionally slow and tedious procedure for customers, increasing the efficiency of field adjusters, and improving communication and repairs with its affiliate craftsmen. Using SightCall allows for assessments of claims from remote locations, enabling agents to see what a customer sees, handling the claim directly through the latter\u2019s mobile device. The customer is guided through the process supported by AR and AI, with valuable data like signatures, high-definition photos, and geolocation collected digitally. With more than 100,000 claims processed this way, adjusters were saved from driving more than 6.3 million kilometers in unnecessary travel, while also boosting satisfaction levels among customers. Case Study 2: Automated processes ensure better management of chronic conditions 1 True Health is a healthcare company providing better information, engagement, and protection to patients with chronic care conditions. The company engages with patients almost entirely remotely, achieving better engagement between them and their healthcare practitioners. Through the use of tools like remote visual assistance, the result has been the improved health and wellness of underserved populations, such as senior citizens. The company created a Care Navigator role, where workers based out of call centers perform chronic care management through SightCall sessions launched with the click of a button in the patient file. With Medicare supporting these virtual patient encounters each month, the company\u2019s Care Navigators track and follow up on care plans, disseminate health and wellness information, and link patients to doctors and specialists, all using the SightCall and Salesforce Health Cloud platforms. This service is accessible to every patient, operating across a wide range of products, reception, and bandwidth levels with identical high call quality and HD picture. Built-in features such as AR-enabled screen annotation and optical character recognition ensure consultations are well-documented, feed reliable information back to care providers, and relay the most accurate care advice possible to patients, wherever they are in their care journeys. Backed by a platform well-suited for telehealth, chronic care patients benefit from easier access to care, without having to drive to a clinic, and can maintain a regular cadence with providers and stay on top of their health. Target your company\u2019s approach to automation Above all, maximizing the benefits of automation for both your business and those it serves means deploying it as one of several customer-facing tools, targeted toward specific use cases that are supported by internal data. Digitization can go a long way in improving day-to-day experiences as well as long-term trends and outcomes, but it is essential to balance the use of these technological tools with easy access to person-to-person support. Evidence-based implementation, combined with the right partner, is what makes this possible.

When they reach out to your call center, they\u2019re seeking fast, comprehensive, and seamless support. Yet, the current paradigm, which relies heavily on text and voice communication, sometimes falls short. Misunderstandings can creep in, hindering the efficiency and effectiveness of your agents, and potentially impacting first contact resolution rates. But imagine a transformation solution: what if your agents could see the customer\u2019s issue, eliminating the guesswork and ambiguity? This isn\u2019t futuristic fantasy\u2014it\u2019s the next frontier of customer support. Envision an environment where customers can visually show, in real-time, the challenges they\u2019re grappling with, bypassing the often cumbersome task of verbal description. Cutting-edge technologies are now making it possible to integrate visual assistance, propelling call centers to levels of service excellence previously unattainable. This is not just an innovation, it\u2019s a game-changer. Let\u2019s dive deeper into how visual assistance is revolutionizing the world of customer support. Introducing\u2026 Visual Assistance The use of live video, images, and augmented reality (AR), and AI-powered insights defines visual assistance. While at first glance, visual assistance may mirror familiar platforms like FaceTime or Zoom, its depth lies in advanced Visual Assistance Platforms (VAPs). These platforms bridge customer service agents and customers, enabling the exchange of real-time visual information, powered by AI-driven insights for seamless communication. Recent statistics have shown an upward trend in the efficacy of visual assistance. For instance, in 2021, 44% of consumers rated video as being \u201chighly effective\u201d at achieving overall satisfaction. And between 2017 and 2021, use of video in customer service interactions increased by 17%. VAPs are an innovative solution that many contact centers are adopting to enhance first contact resolution (FCR) and improve overall customer satisfaction. Visual assistance tools make it easier and faster for agents to diagnose and solve problems, help empower customers to solve problems on their own, and break down language barriers that can hinder customer service resolutions. With tools like live video chat, geolocation, optical character recognition (OCR), augmented-reality (AR), generative AI, and more, VAPs give contact centers the power to design and deploy more intuitive (and more remarkable) customer journeys. Learn more about the technology behind VAPs. Diagnose and Solve Problems with Greater Accuracy and Speed While text-based and verbal communication continue to be crucial in customer service interactions, they often can leave room for misunderstanding, as customers may struggle to accurately describe complex technical issues or product malfunctions. Visual assistance eliminates this barrier by enabling customers to show agents exactly what they see through live video. This allows agents to clearly see and understand the customer\u2019s issue, allowing them to diagnose and resolve the customer\u2019s problem quickly and accurately. For instance, imagine a situation where your customer service agent is assisting a customer who is trying to set up or troubleshoot one of your products. Without visual assistance, the customer must take time to verbally describe their situation as accurately as possible, and the agent must then process this information then attempt to blindly guide the customer through a solution. But with visual assistance, the customer can simply use their smartphone camera to show the product to your agent in real time, along with any connections, error messages, serial numbers, LED lights, or other important information that your agent needs to know. With a clear view of the situation, the agent can then guide the customer step-by-step using annotations or AR overlays, leading to a faster and more successful resolution. See how SightCall is helping Sciex, the leader in mass spectrometry. \u201cThis is more than just having a video call with a customer. The functionality is absolutely transformational for our business. We can annotate, share documents and diagrams, and steer customers to the actions we want them to take.\u201d \u2013 Senior Service Manager, Sciex Help Customers Help Themselves Visual assistance doesn\u2019t just improve the quality and speed of agent-customer interactions. It can also empower customers to solve problems on their own. Customers can use their smartphones to access AR-guided tutorials and visual troubleshooting resources, using generative AI to create efficient, accurate, and enhanced problem-solving steps for them to follow. Having the option of real-time guidance for simple issues reduces the need for customers to call contact agents for problems that can be self-resolved. Break Down Language Barriers When dealing with global customers, contact centers may encounter situations where an agent and a customer cannot communicate effectively due to a language barrier between them. Visual assistance transcends language barriers by taking advantage of visual cues and demonstrations. An agent can guide a customer through a solution using visual aids, regardless of either\u2019s spoken language or language proficiency. Not only can using visual assistance tools (in conjunction with other technologies such as real-time speech-to-text translation) improve your customers\u2019 experience where language barriers need to be overcome, but it can also widen your company\u2019s reach to a more diverse customer base. Take a closer look at SightCall\u2019s Live Translation feature. Maintain the Human Touch in a Digital Era With more technology being incorporated into contact center operations, you may be concerned that these solutions will result in service interactions that are less human. But be assured that visual assistance doesn\u2019t replace the human touch. Rather, it augments it. Visual assistance simply equips your contact centers with powerful tools to provide more effective assistance, while still allowing your customers to build and appreciate personal relationships with your agents. Visual Assistance and the Future of Exceptional Service Incorporating visual assistance into contact center operations can revolutionize the way customer issues are addressed. Using real-time visual communication, your contact centers can improve FCR rates, reduce call durations, and enhance overall customer satisfaction. Embracing innovations like visual assistance, especially those powered by AI, is the road forward for centers striving to excel in our digital age.

The pre-recorded rundown of IVR menu options. The agonizing loop of smooth jazz-inspired hold music. And ultimately, the calm and friendly voice of the agent. Then came emails, texts and chatbots. The rise of personal computers and smartphones put keyboards at the center of our communications. We typed out our problems and waited for the three animated dots to become a response. And for decades, everything worked just fine with voice and text. But humans are visual animals. Our brains process pictures and video exponentially faster than they process text. And showing AND telling, always seems to get us from problem to resolution faster. So if seeing is the secret to speedier customer service solutions, why do so many organizations drag their feet when it comes to implementing video support? As it turns out, there are plenty of reasons, including: Agents don\u2019t want to be on camera. Leadership thinks customers aren\u2019t ready for video support. Voice and text have worked fine for years. Every company has their own list for keeping the blindfolds on and to be honest, visual service doesn\u2019t make sense for everyone. But sometimes the biggest blocker to adding a visual remote support solution is that companies don\u2019t really know where to start. Contact centers are busy places that don\u2019t always have the luxury of time for deep research on the latest tools, trends and technology. Sometimes they need a little nudge in the right direction. So, if you\u2019re a contact center leader wondering how and why to add a visual component to your CX tech stack, here\u2019s a quick-start guide for assessing your options. What is Visual Remote Support? It might help to clarify what we\u2019re talking about when we talk about \u201cvisual remote support.\u201d Sometimes it\u2019s called \u201cremote visual support,\u201d \u201cvideo support\u201d or \u201cvisual assistance.\u201d Essentially, it\u2019s all the same thing\u2026 giving your agents the ability to see what\u2019s wrong on the customer side. But keep in mind that we\u2019re NOT talking about teleconferencing and video calls. This isn\u2019t Zoom or Teams and filling your screen \u201cBrady Bunch style\u201d with a grid of talking heads. This is not PopPop catching up with the grandkids via Facetime or WhatsApp. Visual Remote Support is advanced visual service software that connects to (and works with) your existing contact center technology stack. It\u2019s a professional solution that increases process efficiency, speeds problem resolution and improves the overall customer experience. The key to this technology is its ability to adapt dynamically to variable network conditions without degrading performance. Technically speaking, it does this by employing advanced codecs and adaptive bitrate streaming algorithms, to ensure high-quality video transmission, even in bandwidth-constrained environments. This is a conversation about choosing to go beyond just talk and text and add visuals to your customer interactions. This is about adding a whole new dimension to your contact center. The Rise of Remote Visual Support Technologies First, let\u2019s establish that today\u2019s customers absolutely want visual remote support options. According to Customer Think, video calls have gone up 48% since the end of the pandemic. And research from Metrigy shows that \u201cmore than 95% of consumers want video, screen sharing, or both for interactions such as troubleshooting new products, software support, and consultations.\u201d Why? Because customers prefer more visual and direct forms of communication. And visual technology is central to the ongoing evolution of contact centers towards more integrated and customer-centric service models. Video support plays a critical role in delivering a more personalized and responsive customer experience. Will Visual Remote Support Help? It sounds like a silly question, but knowing exactly how and where remote visual support can improve your customer experience is important to understand before going forward. It might not be a fit. That\u2019s why it\u2019s worth taking a closer look at your workflows and processes to understand exactly how a visual solution could improve efficiency. Visual remote support makes sense if your contact center: Supports complex products that require advanced troubleshooting Struggles with a high call volume and needs to reduce resolution time Provides technical support that requires more precise guidance Wants to deliver a more personal customer experience The main advantage of this technology is that it allows agents to add augmented reality (AR) annotations directly onto the live video feed. This lets them visually guide customers step-by-step through complex troubleshooting. With AR and real-time visual feedback, it reduces the mental effort for both customers and agents, helping ensure instructions are followed correctly. Remote visual support can also use computer vision and AI to recognize barcodes and labels. For example, it can automatically identify key components, parts, or serial numbers during a support session. This AI feature helps agents quickly identify issues without needing customers to manually enter complicated details, making it especially useful in customer service for consumer devices. Visual remote support is more than just adding video to customer calls. While adding a face-to-face, human connection has its benefits, the real value comes from allowing your agents to put expert eyes on the problem. By giving customers the power to show AND tell at the same time, you save precious minutes that would have otherwise been wasted by customers struggling to describe something complex over the phone or in a text or email. Instead of \u201cmy coffee maker\u2019s steam thingy is making a funny squeaking noise when I press the button.\u201d A customer can point their smartphone\u2019s back camera at the appliance to give the agent immediate context with live video. An agent can SEE which button is pressed, they can HEAR the squeak of the steam wand and they can ANALYZE that there is likely a gasket that needs to be replaced. If it was a quick fix, visual remote support would allow the agent to GUIDE the customer step-by-step through a simple repair, completely eliminating the need for a product return or on-site repair call. In most cases, visual support provides the shortest distance between problem and solution. 4 Questions to Ask when Choosing a Solution Every company has their own process for evaluating new digital tools. Maybe you have 20 questions, maybe you have 200. But here are 4 high-level queries to help narrow down your visual remote support choices. Is it compatible? If a solution doesn\u2019t connect with your current platform, then it\u2019s not really a solution. It needs to adapt to your daily digital environment. You need a remote support tool to use the data you have and share the data it collects. Advanced solutions provide RESTful APIs that easily integrate with your existing tech stack, including CRM systems like Salesforce and ServiceNow; CCaaS platforms like NICE, Genesys, and Five9; customer data platforms (CDPs), and custom backend systems. The last thing you want is a collection of disconnected tools that don\u2019t communicate and only add more steps and frustration. Integration should also enable real-time data exchange, allowing the support tool to pull diagnostic data from asset management systems, connected devices, or IoT sensors during a visual session. This adds valuable technical insight for more effective troubleshooting and product diagnostics. Is it easy to use? If it\u2019s not, your agents won\u2019t use it and your customers will get annoyed. Keep in mind that almost half (49%) of customers have left a brand in the past year due to bad customer experiences. Technologies like natural language processing (NLP) built into the visual interface can offer context-aware guidance and real-time suggestions to agents. Solutions that support multiple input types\u2014like images, voice, text, and visual cues\u2014give agents more flexibility in managing support sessions. The lines between B2B and B2C get blurrier every day. The more you can use tools that are as intuitive and friendly as the best-selling and most-used consumer apps, the better your adoption rates and CSAT scores will be. Is it simple like FaceTime? Easy as Uber? As intuitive as Amazon? It should be. Will it scale? Is the solution designed to grow with your company? How does it leverage AI to help your organization get smarter with every customer interaction? Does it regularly update integrations and forge new partnerships? Cloud-based remote visual support solutions offer scalable infrastructure, allowing them to handle more concurrent sessions without losing performance. Look for solutions that incorporate or experiment with GenAI and computer vision models, whether integrated or custom-built. As AI evolves, your support tool should be able to structure visual interactions for multimodal AI use. This enhances both agent efficiency and predictive troubleshooting. True scalability also means future-proofing. Advanced solutions should offer modular upgrades for adding new visual features like AR, VR, and MR, ensuring your investment stays valuable as technology advances. Adopting a visual remote support solution isn\u2019t a casual fling. It\u2019s the start of a serious software relationship and it\u2019s totally justified to ask questions like, \u201cWhere do you see yourself in 5 years?\u201d Is it secure? Don\u2019t forget that digital threats are evolving just as quickly as technology. If security and compliance are a paramount concern for your company, make certain that the creators of your visual support solution feel the same way. Look for remote visual support solutions that provide end-to-end encryption for all video, audio, and data exchanges. This ensures that sensitive customer information remains protected throughout the interaction. Confirm that your specific security standards can be met, whether you operate globally (GDPR) or deal with sensitive personal medical information (HIPAA). For organizations with strict regulations like HIPAA or GDPR, it\u2019s essential that the solution complies with these standards. Advanced solutions may also include role-based access control (RBAC) and audit trails, offering more transparency into how sensitive data is managed and who has access during a session. Core Features of Effective Remote Visual Support Solutions The capabilities of any visual support solution will vary, but most will come with these core features: Real-time video \u2013 Clear and reliable video is essential for visual remote support. High-definition video resolution, paired with adaptive bitrate streaming technology, ensures smooth, uninterrupted sessions, even in low-bandwidth environments. Look for solutions that provide at least 1080p resolution at 30 frames per second (fps) to ensure both visual clarity and smooth interactions. What is the video resolution and frame rate? How does it perform under varying network conditions? Are there features to optimize video quality during low bandwidth conditions? How often do video calls drop or experience significant lag? Annotation tools \u2013 The ability to annotate on a customer\u2019s screen can improve the clarity of communication and speed to a solution. Some tools use augmented reality to add even more layers of real-time insight to customer problems. Real-time annotation tools are vital for guiding customers through complex processes. Advanced solutions should provide AR overlays, enabling agents to highlight areas, draw shapes, or mark next steps directly on the video feed. These annotations should sync with the customer\u2019s view to ensure clear guidance during troubleshooting. Just as important, these AR overlays should be tagged and structured as data to capture and store visual expertise for future problem-solving. What types of annotations are available (e.g., drawing, text, shapes, highlighting)? Can annotations be made in real-time during a video call? Are there features to save or export annotated images or videos for future reference? Generative AI \u2013 Many visual remote support solutions are incorporating Gen AI into their features. While some use them as co-pilots and chatbots, others add them to digital process automation sequences and customer self-service workflows. AI enhances remote visual support by offering intelligent assistance before and during sessions. Top solutions use generative AI to process images, video, voice, and text, providing agents with contextual suggestions and customers with predictive guidance. A key feature to look for is AI that can analyze past data to anticipate common issues, reducing downtime and improving first-call resolution rates. What types of inputs can the AI process (e.g., text, voice, image, video)? How intuitive is the AI interface for both agents and customers? What are the potential cost savings or productivity gains from using the AI\u2019s multimodal capabilities? Evaluate the Vendors Once you narrow down what you want and need, the next step is vetting your vendors. Choose a provider with proven expertise and a strong market reputation. Read customer testimonials and case studies to get insights into the real-world applications and effectiveness of their solution. Ask about the levels of customer support and training. Is there a clear roadmap or onboarding process? Will you be assigned a Customer Success representative? What is the plan for adoption? Are there contingencies in place if the solution isn\u2019t embraced by agents and/or customers? Does the provider offer support or strategies for re-engagement? Understand the Pricing Models and ROI Expectations In the end, it all comes down to money. How much do these solutions cost? How much can they save you? And sometimes, how much additional revenue can they help you generate? What are the available pricing models? Is there a cost per seat or per call? A subscription fee? Do the pricing models fit your organization\u2019s needs and goals? Speaking of goals, make sure there\u2019s a clear understanding of ROI for the solution. Solicit hard numbers and success stories from the provider\u2019s previous clients. Compare apples to apples and set realistic expectations for your visual remote support rollout. If your ROI aspirations aren\u2019t aligned with industry standards, it\u2019s probably time to go back to the top of the article and ask that super obvious question one more time: Will visual remote support help? The Future of Service is Visual It\u2019s hard to imagine exactly what tomorrow\u2019s service landscape will look like, but it will definitely be worth seeing. Based on advances in AI, AR and VR, the days of rectangular screens and traditional physical space may be numbered. Maybe our washing machine will call for service when it needs it or even learn to fix itself. However it shapes up, customer service is already on track to become more effective and efficient. In the future, we\u2019ll be more connected than ever before, with vast networks of people and programs working together to fix problems. Solutions will be found faster. The blindfolds will come off. Our cameras will be on. And our eyes will be wide open.

Using its 86 billion neurons and 100 trillion connections, it can multitask like a miraculous machine, simultaneously interpreting emotions, solving problems and thinking creatively. But all is not as advertised. The human brain is much more fragile than we\u2019ve been led to believe. Asking it to do too much is asking for trouble. Walking and chewing gum is easy. Talking and typing? No problem. But before hopping on a unicycle to juggle chainsaws while giving a TED Talk (aka working as a contact center agent), you should understand the serious consequences of cognitive overload. What is Cognitive Overload? Today\u2019s contact center agents are working with some of the most advanced technology in history. It\u2019s easy to be impressed with the speed and power of cutting-edge computers connected to the cloud. The magic of AI. The ease of automation. But as much as our hardware gets faster and better every year, every agent is still working with the same brains humans have had since the Stone Age. And it turns out that it doesn\u2019t take much to crash them like an old PC running Windows 8. Cognitive overload happens when the demands on an individual\u2019s working memory exceed their capacity to process information efficiently. Human working memory has a limited capacity, typically capable of holding about 7 (plus or minus 2) pieces of information at a time. Exceed that limit and cognitive overload kicks in, making it difficult to process and retain information effectively. You can see how relevant this is in environments where individuals are required to handle multiple tasks simultaneously or process a high volume of complex information. While people can still function in a state of cognitive overload, it will, obviously, lead to poor performance and more mistakes. Much like a car with a flat tire will still move forward, driving on it will eventually cost you your ride. Debunking the Myth of Multitasking There is no such thing as multitasking. The truth is that the human brain is not designed to handle multiple high-focus tasks at the same time. It can switch between tasks rapidly, but even this switching comes at a steep cognitive cost. When switching from one task to another, the brain has to reorient to the new task. That reorientation and adjustment uses effort and energy, which can reduce overall efficiency and add time to every task. You can FEEL more productive, but the science begs to differ. Researchers at Stanford University found that heavy multitaskers are actually worse at filtering out irrelevant information, organizing their thoughts, and switching between tasks compared to those who focus on one task at a time. And another study from the University of London found that multitasking can actually lower IQ scores. Participants who were multitasking during cognitive tests experienced a significant drop in their IQ scores, similar to what one might experience after losing a night\u2019s sleep. The Benefits of Slowing Down We live in an accelerated world. And at work, agents are expected to move faster and do more than ever before. And the forecast for the future shows no signs of slowing down. Since the onset of the pandemic, the number of calls marked as \u201cdifficult\u201d by contact center agents has increased by around 50%. This complexity contributes significantly to cognitive overload, as agents handle more challenging queries than ever before\u200b ( CX Today )\u200b. There has been a 68% increase in issues being escalated up the chain of command, indicating that agents are struggling to resolve problems on the first call due to cognitive overload and insufficient training\u200b ( Omnicus )\u200b. Most of us have learned how to function with certain levels of cognitive overload. We chalk it up to the \u201cmodern pace of work.\u201d But as contact center managers and leaders, you have a basic responsibility to keep it at bay. Because while cognitive overload can result in reduced productivity and beat up your bottom line, the real damage comes to those on the front line. Cognitive overload leads to higher levels of stress and fatigue among employees and long-term exposure can negatively impact mental health and job satisfaction. Not only do you miss your metrics, you end up forcing much more turnover. How to Reduce Cognitive Overload for Agents Implementing tools and systems that support cognitive processing, such as automated workflows, can help reduce overload by streamlining tasks and reducing the cognitive burden. Training programs that focus on improving efficient information processing can also be beneficial. But the most powerful one-two punch might be leveraging AI and self-service. On average, contact center agents handle 41 conversations per day. Those high volumes of interactions can involve simple, repetitive tasks that contribute to cognitive overload\u200b. Eliminating more of that mundane work is an easy way to reduce the noise and protect agents from suffering \u201cdeath by 1000 cuts.\u201d Dispatching AI chatbots and integrating smarter, automated processes relieves the pressure and frees them to focus on the most urgent matters. And it works, too. According to a study from Fit Small Business, approximately 60% of contact center agents report that AI helps them save time by automating repetitive tasks like routing calls and processing inquiries\u200b. Adding self-service options can remove tasks from an agent\u2019s plate altogether. More than half of consumers prefer self-service options, and even if the DIY options don\u2019t get your customer all the way to a solution, you\u2019ve lightened the load for your most valuable assets. While the rapid rise of technology in contact centers has turned customer service into a high-stakes game of mental gymnastics, it\u2019s important to remember that our agents aren\u2019t superheroes\u2014they\u2019re human. By embracing AI, automating workflows, and offering top-notch training, we can help our agents avoid burnout and boost productivity. Not only will this lead to fewer mistakes and happier customers, but it will also mean less stress and a more sustainable work environment.

A strong core gives you the power needed to run a marathon, swing a golf club or even sweep the floor. Core strength gives you balance and stability. It protects you against injuries, falls and a lifetime of pain. The same goes for your contact center. A well-functioning contact center is the core of your company\u2019s customer service machine. When run smoothly and efficiently, it can become much more than a complaint department or cost center. It can become a loyalty-building, brand-boosting, cost-saving, revenue-generation machine! But contact center optimization is a process. You need to walk before you can run. That\u2019s why it\u2019s crucial to focus on three core tactics that can help you optimize operations for efficiency, improved customer satisfaction, and overall business growth. 1. Embrace Technology and Automation Leveraging technology and automation is a game-changer for contact centers. Implementing advanced software solutions and tools can streamline processes, reduce manual tasks, and enhance customer interactions. Intelligent Call Routing: Utilizing AI-powered call routing can ensure customers are directed to the most suitable agent based on their needs and historical data. This reduces call transfers and enhances first-call resolution rates. Chatbots and Self-Service: Incorporate chatbots and self-service options for routine inquiries. Customers appreciate quick solutions without the need to wait for an agent, resulting in improved satisfaction and reduced agent workload. Analytics and Insights: Employ analytics tools to gather insights from customer interactions. These insights can help identify trends, pain points, and opportunities for process improvement. Visual Assistance: Leverage technology platforms that combine enhanced video (with AR and AI capability) and digital process automation. Adding the power of sight to customer interactions can speed complex problem-solving, improve empathy and build personalized and productive customer journeys. \u201cAdoption of video support has increased 47% since 2020.\u201d \u2013 Salesforce State of Service, 2022 2. Empower Your Agents Your agents are the frontline representatives of your brand, and their satisfaction and performance directly impact customer experiences. Never underestimate the power of a contact center agent who loves their job. Boost Agent Satisfaction (ASAT) by offering employees: Comprehensive Training: Your agents should be well-versed in product knowledge, communication skills, and problem-solving techniques. Well-trained agents feel confident and capable in handling various situations. Ongoing Coaching and Feedback: Implement regular coaching sessions and performance reviews. Constructive feedback and guidance help agents refine their skills and boost their confidence. Access to Knowledge: Equip agents with easy access to a knowledge base containing FAQs, troubleshooting guides, and best practices. This minimizes the need for lengthy research during customer interactions. Enhanced Technology: Empower agents to be top performers by equipping them with technology designed to help them deliver leading KPIs like improving handle time, first contact resolution, and CSAT scores. Agents want tools that augment their ability to provide important empathetic customer connections. \u201c76% of CX leaders say there is low morale in the contact center.\u201d \u2013 Genesys \u201cTop Customer Experience Stats to Know in 2023\u201d 3. Prioritize Data Security and Compliance In an era where data breaches and privacy concerns are on the rise, safeguarding customer data is non-negotiable. Ensuring compliance with industry regulations and building trust with your customers is essential. Can you confidently check all these boxes? Secure Infrastructure: Invest in robust security measures to protect customer data. Encryption, secure authentication, and regular security audits are crucial components. Data Privacy Compliance: Stay up-to-date with data protection regulations such as GDPR, CCPA, and HIPAA, depending on your industry and geography. Implement processes to handle customer data in a compliant manner. Transparent Communication: Clearly communicate your data usage policies to customers. Building trust by being transparent about how their data is collected, used, and protected goes a long way in maintaining strong customer relationships. \u201cJust 22% of contact center organizations are deploying modern authentication and fraud prevention procedures\u201d \u2013 Opus Research 2023 Global Survey: State of Intelligent Authentication and Contact Center Security Maintaining Contact Center Optimization Momentum Besides being a mouthful to say, \u201cmaintaining contact center optimization momentum\u201d is the hard part. The first step to getting your contact center in shape is strengthening your customer service core. But the secret to KEEPING it in shape is far from routine. Ongoing optimization requires a steady diet of customer insight and more than a bit of boldness. It requires an understanding that the company/customer relationship is constantly evolving. Expectations and demands are ever-changing. And technology is racing to keep up. Enterprise contact centers that are thriving today have embraced agility and flexibility. They have leaned into innovation leveraging technologies like AR-enhanced video, computer vision, and generative AI. Today, these leading contact centers are combining all three of these technologies to solve the most complex and highest valued customer problems. Long ago they traded answering machines for chatbots and moved from cubicles to the cloud. And they remain curious and open to what comes next. Nobody knows exactly what the future holds. But here\u2019s one thing we know for sure: If you embrace technology, empower your agents, and prioritize data security, you\u2019ll not only meet customer expectations\u2026 you\u2019ll exceed them.

While the COVID-19 pandemic is receding or becoming more manageable in many places around the world, the magnitude of disruption it posed to company operations was enlightening. Despite the fact that supply chains seized up and physical travel became unsafe and frequently impossible due to restrictions, enterprises still needed to inspect essential assets, comply with industry regulations and auditing requirements, and respond promptly to customer concerns. In other words, businesses needed a way for the show to go on, despite whatever external pressures they were facing. For small businesses, in particular, the use of free communication tools like WhatsApp or FaceTime were frequently embraced as a stopgap measure. But privacy concerns, lack of integration with important field service management (FSM) systems (Salesforce, SAP, ServiceMax, and more), and limitations of the platform themselves made these unsuitable for long-term use. In this article, we will examine how remote video inspection puts enterprise experts where they\u2019re needed, when they\u2019re needed, for both customer and regulatory requirements. We also introduce remote visual inspection solutions that come with fast, flexible implementation. What is remote video inspection? Remote video inspection, sometimes referred to as remote visual inspection or simply \u201cremote inspection,\u201d is the process of using real-time video technology to scope and inspect a physical location, a company asset like a piece of equipment, or a customer product or device that needs to be examined or repaired. Remote inspection can be quite dynamic, and with the right platform, practically indistinguishable from an in-person site visit. Remote video inspection options have been around for a while in some form, though many companies considered them niche, perhaps even unnecessary for normal operations. The COVID-19 pandemic changed this landscape because companies couldn\u2019t go where they needed to but still needed to ensure continuity of business. Some of the key benefits of remote video inspection include: Improved carbon footprint Reduced parts wastage Faster time-to-inspection Improved inspector/technician utilization Increased customer satisfaction Maintained business continuity Decreased costs Not all inspections can be replaced by video alone, but in many cases, they can be completely augmented by video platforms that call on advanced technologies like augmented reality, artificial intelligence, and digital process automation. These technologies work in harmony with live video to help inspectors to see the remote environment as if they were onsite. Platforms like SightCall help smart devices to see the environment as well, taking stock of the physical equipment and presenting contextual data back to the remote inspector for analysis and review. How does Augmented Reality (AR) improve remote video inspections? AR is the enhancement of an interactive, virtual component onto a real-world environment or situation, layering tools like informational text and 3D graphics on top of a user\u2019s field of vision. The use of AR tools has witnessed exponential growth over the past several years \u2013 with more than 1.7 billion global users projected in 2024 alone. AR tools combined with live video provide inspectors and technicians with the context they need to accurately perform tasks. They can make on-screen annotations, get accurate measurements remotely, and share images and information during the live video call. In fact, by harnessing AR capabilities, it\u2019s possible for technicians to take advantage of the quicker processes, perform more inspections than would otherwise be possible, and even prioritize site visits, where possible, through the use of remote triaging. Broadly speaking, our internal data shows inspections with augmented reality are capable of achieving: 81% growth in first-time fix rates A 69% reduction in time to issue resolution, and a 50% reduction in truck rolls Knowledge savings through a 41% decrease in training time Customer satisfaction increases by as high as 30 points How does Digital Process Automation (DPA) improve remote video inspections? DPA is the path to self-guided work experiences which standardize workflows, improve performance and mitigate paper process errors that can derail essential processes. This ensures that inspectors are all working in the same fashion, collecting data as prescribed by their organization, and ensuring that the proper data is collected and stored with accuracy before they leave the job site. SightCall\u2019s own DPA solution, Digital Flows, allows inspectors, technicians, and customers to complete remote video inspections, pre-inspections, and other applicable tasks with no ambiguity or confusion. Following a prescribed set of instructions, they can work through digital flows that help them to document information, interact with equipment in their environment, and then call on the live support of a remote expert when escalation is needed. Using data collected from the digital flows, the remote expert is already prepared with the context needed to help the person onsite. The training process also becomes more straightforward, with digital process automation providing new technicians or workers needing to upskill with an immersive and straightforward learning experience that happens on the job. Below, we examine several examples of remote video inspections, all AR-guided and some with digital process automation included, in the real world. Use cases for remote visual inspections Case study 1: Food safety revolutionized with remote video audits Safe food practices impact consumers all over the world and are crucial for human health. As such, verification involves a complex, multi-level system of inspections and audits, ones which Kraft Heinz uses to ensure quality assurance, identify and coordinate improvements, and resolve issues related to customer complaints. At the onset of the COVID-19 crisis, Kraft Heinz needed to maintain continuous high standards of food safety for consumers, without disrupting a supply chain built on a wide global network of suppliers, co-packers, and warehouses. It needed a remote video inspection platform that was robust enough to be implemented in a variety of specific use cases while allowing for the standardization of both routine and incident-related audits. Together Kraft Heinz and SightCall were able to roll out a live video inspection process within a matter of weeks, digitally transforming their processes to integrate visual support into visits that were traditionally onsite. Previously, visits such as factory tours and inspections could take up to three days, entailing multiple visits. This was due to the need to review relevant documents and certifications while on-site \u2013 something that can now be done with virtual inspections in advance. Now, before inspections begin, SightCall sessions are used for pre-inspections where relevant documents and logistics can be arranged. During the actual inspection, expert remote auditors can work through their inspection checklists and see the facility as if they are onsite. With full control of the mobile device being used for the inspection, they can deploy features like a flashlight to have better visibility, or use AR annotations to illustrate recommendations and identify potential problems. With the ability to capture and save high-resolution photos from the live video stream, they can store visual records of equipment and processes alongside the inspection or audit documents. With less travel, simple coordination, quicker resolution times, and the ease of storing documentation, the number of inspections and audits conducted has skyrocketed \u2013 with the added benefit of a socially conscious company with a lower carbon footprint. Case Study 2: Remote support is essential for the standardization of offshore rig work One of the world\u2019s biggest energy technology companies needed to standardize maintenance and repair processes, including in remote and high-risk locations, while also improving audit compliance and reducing their carbon footprint. Their need for highly specialized engineers to complete various tasks meant that numerous in-person site visits were often required, and this posed a distinct challenge for offshore oil rigs. Deployment times were traditionally measured not in days, but in weeks. Additionally, the company\u2019s engineers logged their work and notes with pen and paper. They jotted down what repairs and maintenance tasks they performed on a wide range of highly specialized equipment, and then transferred those notes to a database at the end of long shifts. This came with considerable risk. In fact, the business once paid back close to $1 million to a customer when a repair was improperly documented and unverifiable. By contrast, with remote support for repair and maintenance, a technician can access a specific SightCall Digital Flow on their mobile device. As they go through the automated process, they are prompted to enter all relevant information and collect helpful media, such as photos or videos. Engineers scan a serial or model number, automatically capture display readings, perform accurate AR measurements, and document and confirm their work on the spot. The company subsequently achieved hundreds of thousands of dollars in reduced travel costs in just six months, with significant savings realized on every site visit including a reduced carbon footprint. Case Study 3: Savings in local government with virtual inspections Central Bedfordshire Council averages 25,000 routine repairs a year, which are reported by tenants through a telephone line or customer app. First-time fix rates and the convenience of scheduling repairs were long a problem for the Council, but crucially, its internal research showed the majority of tenants had smartphones \u2013 and were comfortable accessing services online. During early lockdowns in the UK in 2020, emergency repairs continued, but routine repairs decreased, with tenants becoming understandably reluctant to book in-person appointments. As such, a combination of virtual and limited face-to-face solutions were needed to continue services while also minimizing risk for both tenants and workers. Security was paramount, as well as the need for a solution that could directly provide resources to tenants and collect information about their needs including photos and measurements. The Council deployed SightCall in a matter of weeks to their maintenance advisory team \u2013 the ones responsible for responding to tenant repair requests. Using a combination of SightCall and diagnostic software, the team triaged repairs by viewing the problem remotely and consulting their technical documentation. This eliminated the need to have highly trained experts on the front-line of customer support or a site visit. Employees and workers can now approve or void work orders, verify emergency requests, and plan and manage large renovation projects remotely. The need for multiple site visits and the associated travel time was drastically reduced. First-time fix rates have risen from 77.3% to 98.84% since deployment. In fact, cutting down on the number of unnecessary site visits increases the total number of repairs that can be completed by the team. Within weeks of deploying SightCall, the maintenance teams were able to clear the backlog created as a result of COVID-related restrictions. Case Study 4: Repair and maintenance of diagnostic equipment simplified GE Healthcare, a global health technology company, specializes in the engineering and production of diagnostic machinery \u2013 including MRI, CT, and X-ray scanners. When troubleshooting an issue during a field maintenance visit was especially complicated, a field technician frequently mobilized one of their peers or a more senior technician to the job site, resulting in multiple trips and greater labor costs applied to a work order. This often caused the affected machinery to be out of use for a considerable period of time while a solution was found \u2013 much to a clinician\u2019s detriment. A day, let alone longer, without an MRI scanner creates a significant barrier. Patient appointments must be delayed or canceled, and the scanner becomes unavailable in the event an emergency arises. The company\u2019s goal was to shorten the length of time on-site and improve first-time fix rates, reducing the need for multiple trips. When searching for a visual assistance solution, a priority was to achieve the highest possible call quality to facilitate real-time work order completion, as well as a higher issue resolution rate. Today, GE Healthcare complements its field support solution with SightCall AR-powered visual assistance, drawn especially to its ease of scalability. Field technicians were impressed by the reliable video quality and consistent audio and video. They could carry out remote-guided repairs with greater ease and agility, thanks to touchless capabilities using the device of their choice. Site data, like product serial numbers, could be fed back to the work order with the smartphone camera simply held in front of the desired data to read it, with no manual entry required. GE Healthcare noticed an increase in several key performance indicators, most notably with improved resolution rates. Maintenance turnaround times were shortened to averages of six to eight hours, versus three days prior to the implementation of SightCall. With the average call taking only 40 minutes, the company estimates it has saved hundreds of thousands of dollars through improved medical device uptime. Case Study 5: Visual Assistance technology revolutionizes remote property repairs and insurance claim inspections Research from J.D. Power in 2021 concluded that the use of seamless digital filing services to complete insurance claims information resulted in higher performance and satisfaction scores across the board. For certain, a growing number of insurers, as well as their partners meeting policyholder needs, are turning to remote inspections for more rapid initial response times and expedited solutions. A global third-party administrator (TPA) working closely with insurance companies, their adjusters and homeowners needed a standardized way to ensure that repair work among a large and widespread contractor network was performed and inspected to exacting standards. This company offers customized managed repair, restoration, and mitigation, with contractors spanning some 2,000 locations. Offering a one-stop solution for securing high-quality repairs for property damage and restoration work meant the company earned a reputation among homeowners as one of the nation\u2019s most trusted names in the restoration industry. But the sheer number of contractors made standardized repair processes all but impossible to achieve, at least without multiple inspections and redundancies. Safety and regulatory compliance issues also became a concern. Today, the company harnesses SightCall Digital Flows integrated within customer relationship management (CRM) software. When kicking off an insurance claim or property inspection, a Digital Flow guides the contractor to record a video of the work site while describing the work needed. The contractor is then prompted to identify any safety concerns present. Selecting any of these will trigger an action that immediately loops in the people needed to approve the work so it can move forward. A task is generated in the CRM, notifying the relevant party to review the case file and associated media. During the repair, remote support can also be used to monitor the quality of the work. For instance, contractors are prompted to take videos with commentary about the work for each relevant room or area in the house. If any additional work needs are identified, they can be instantly sent directly to a supervisor of the project and an insurance adjuster for carrier approval. Full and auditable documentation acts as a quality check. And for stressed homeowners, repair projects are completed faster, with fewer errors, maximizing satisfaction. Being able to inspect and approve work remotely has already helped to reduce delays, and eliminate unnecessary site visits. Discover how remote inspections can unleash your company\u2019s potential With the right partner, implementing remote video inspections can future-proof and disruption-proof your organization \u2013 well ahead of the next crisis.

How Are Visual Claims Disrupting The Claims Process? SightCall Challenge of traditional claims process One of the common challenges insurance companies face when it comes to claims is how they can make the process more efficient for customers. Processing claims takes time and resources regardless of size especially for claims valued at $10,000 or less where it is not cost effective to have an adjuster evaluate the damage on site. Mobile changed customer expectations Customer expectations today are demanding and they want instant results. Mobile technology is transforming customer expectations. Nigel Walsh who is the head of Insurance in the UK for CapGemini stated at a recent TechUK meeting that. \u201cCustomers are getting more savvy. Expectations have gone up but insurers are not meeting those expectations.\u201d Traditional claim processes meet disruptive technology Using technology to engage with the customer, the InsurTech transformation is addressing the gap between self-serve applications and traditional onsite visits with video. Solutions such as SightCall Visual Claims are utilizing mobile video to allow policyholders to file claims in real time. It is all about the customer using technology that engages them and allows them to show the damage with their smartphone. Don\u2019t fall short of customer expectations. They are ready While starting in early stages of implementation, major insurance companies were only expecting 10% of their customers to accept this new approach. Instead, they reported receiving more than 80% positive participation. The mobile mind definitely shifted the expectation that \u201cI can get what I want immediately\u201d. Providing an instantaneous solution to customers has become essential in how successful insurance companies distinguish their value from the competition. Is insurance ready? Reducing claim cycle times from days to hours not only results in high customer satisfaction but also creates massive savings. The monthly cost of the technology can usually be covered by one single video session avoiding an onsite visit. Decision is a no brainer. Now the challenge resides in the change management. Insurance customers are ready but are insurance employees ready to change their way of working?

Leaders from across the world, including Joe Biden, Boris Johnson, Emmanuel Macron, Angela Merkel, and Justin Trudeau to name a few, have come together to discuss one of the biggest issues the world currently faces, climate change. The planet\u2019s average surface temperature has risen 1.18 degrees Celsius since the late 19th century, and it\u2019s expected it will rise again by another 1.5 degrees in the next two decades. Most of this warming has happened in the last 40 years, with the last 7 years being the warmest on record, globally. In a 2018 special report by the IPCC, they warned that we have until 2030 to prevent the worst impacts of climate change on our planet. Yet since then, nothing has been done to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. With the COVID-19 pandemic delaying the COP26 conference by a year, these world leaders have finally come together to establish a plan and declare their intentions on how they can collectively start to bring climate change under control: Over 100 countries, including the US, have pledged to reduce global methane gas emissions by 30% by 2030 100 of the world\u2019s nations, including Brazil- home to the Amazon, have agreed to end deforestation by 2030 and pledge \u00a314bn of public and private funds to do so UK big businesses will be forced to show how they will hit net zero by 2023, providing detailed plans to the Government 450 organizations controlling $130 trillion dollars, around 40% of global private assets, agreed to back \u201cclean\u201d technology, such as renewable energy At least 23 nations have made new commitments to phase out coal power, including six of the top 20 users: Indonesia, South Korea, Poland, Vietnam, Chile, and Ukraine Greenhouse Gas Emissions 29% of global greenhouse gas emissions come from transportation, primarily from burning fossil fuels for our cars, trucks, ships, trains and planes. Road transport accounts for three-quarters of those emissions. The average petrol car on the road in the UK produces the equivalent of 180g of CO2 every kilometre. In the US the average passenger vehicle on the road releases 650g of CO2/km. In the western world, we have become increasingly dependent on using our cars even for very short journeys. In England for example, around 60% of 1\u20132-mile trips are made by car. Using a car, van or truck is also common when we think about service organizations who need to carry out maintenance work at a site, install new equipment for a customer, inspect supply chains, or even when an adjuster is needed for an on-site insurance claim. With a spotlight now on businesses to provide detailed planning on how they will reduce greenhouse gas emissions and act more sustainably as a whole, what can businesses do to make a quick and lasting impact on reducing their road travel? Implementing Visual Assistance for a More Sustainable Business Model Visual assistance technology is helping connect technicians and customers in the field to remote experts, who can guide them to fix issues remotely and avoid sending unnecessary support out into the field. Even when an expert is required to travel on-site, visual assistance enables remote diagnosis of the issue to ensure the right expert with the right skills and parts is dispatched- removing the problem of having multiple callouts for one issue. The benefits of visual assistance are vast and include improving machine uptime, reducing the time it takes to train new technicians, increasing first-time fix rates, decreasing issue resolution times, and providing an experience that delights customers. But when we think about service organizations reducing greenhouse gas emissions, decreasing truck rolls and technician callouts is the benefit that really packs a punch and can help these organizations in their pursuit to be net-zero by 2050. Using SightCall\u2019s visual assistance, our service customers have been able to reduce costly (for both their bottom lines and for the planet) truck rolls by at least 50%. SightCall can now also provide its customers with monthly sustainability reporting through our new CO2 calculator, highlighting this reduced road travel and the impact it has on business CO2 emissions when using visual assistance. When we think about the mandatory sustainability reporting for UK and EU businesses coming into effect, this kind of regular and accurate sustainability data and reporting is like gold dust. As COP26 comes to an end we will have to wait and see if the attending world leaders live up to their promises and drive the change that is so desperately needed. For those organizations who are looking to make a lasting environmental impact from today, SightCall\u2019s visual assistance is the answer to a more sustainable business model that significantly reduces road travel, and with data that can be tracked and reported on regularly to meet these new requirements.

With more agility and less cumbersome technology restrictions, small to mid-sized businesses can lead the change for the insurance industry. One recent example comes from a third-party insurance adjuster company that found their need for remote visual support change overnight at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy. The Lercari Group supports customers in underwriting, risk transfer, crisis situations, after-sales service, and emerging risks. Prior to COVID-19, their model, like many in the insurance industry was highly dependent on having loss adjusters travel for on-site claims evaluations. The claims resolution process could be quite long, due in large part to travel and the facetime needed for their experts to obtain the information and evidence they needed. Optimizing customer experience and satisfaction was similarly limited. Originally founded in Italy in 1879, the company has more than a century of experience. Now, with over 300 employees in 18 offices across Europe and as a member of the prestigious Sedgwick Alliance of insurance providers, they\u2019ve been comfortable with adapting to changes in technology and the industry landscape for quite some time. The Lercari Group was an early adopter of visual claims transformation. Having already shifted to using SightCall for motor claims, the group saw the potential for the technology to reduce travel, improve customer experience, control costs, and pave the way for a more efficient claims process. When the first lockdowns of the COVID-19 pandemic were initiated in Italy in March 2020, The Lercari Group found themselves digitally transforming their entire loss adjusting business overnight. As early as January 31, Italy had declared a national emergency, and by March the entire country and all 60 million residents were under lockdown. A survey on Italian businesses in March and April of 2020 showed that the number of businesses expecting a negative impact was 97.2% with 37.9% of surveyed businesses expecting severe impacts. COVID-19 Timeline in Italy The country and businesses within it were thrown into confusion. The Lecari Group\u2019s main offices were in one of the first red zones where travel was prohibited. Immediately recognizing that they would no longer be able to service customers in person, they contacted SightCall. Overnight they were able to accelerate their digital transformation and put the SightCall platform to use for all their claims. \u201cIn the context of COVID-19, SightCall kept our supply chain from being interrupted,\u201d said TPA project manager Magdalena Szwalbe. \u201cThe most important benefit for us is related to insurance companies, who are our first clients. Without SightCall, it wouldn\u2019t be possible to provide services to insurers, who in turn couldn\u2019t provide services to their claimants/clients in order to finalize claim proceedings.\u201d Between January and May, the Lecari Group clocked over 5000 video support calls and they have continued to increase the number of claims that can be handled virtually.

With the new iPhone 12 Pro and Pro Max models, Apple adds LiDAR technology that will improve photos and existing AR apps, as well as open more possibilities for the future of AR and remote visual support. LiDAR stands for light detection and ranging, and the technology uses lasers to ping off objects and measure their rate of return. It\u2019s a time-of-flight camera using the same technology as the front-facing true-depth camera used for Face ID but is much more powerful iPad Pro LiDAR meshing using ARKit LiDAR technology has been around for a while, and is commonly used in robotics, drones, and self-driving cars. But previously the technology was deemed too costly and bulky for mobile devices. Without LiDAR, most mobile devices use a pulse of light in a similar way, with far less accuracy. With Apple\u2019s reign as a technology leader this addition will likely herald a new rush for wide adoption and pave the way for incredible applications. LiDAR will immediately improve photos especially in low-light conditions, speeding up focus by up to six times. Improved image capture will make SightCall features like the Smart Optical Character Recognition even more powerful. AR applications will also have instant benefits, enabling better mapping for placing of 3D objects and the ability to place virtual objects in more complicated environments or partially hide them behind real ones. SightCall uses AR to overlay relevant information and add annotations and guidance to the screen. These features help remote experts communicate clearly on complex tasks and resolve problems with their customers or field technicians. As devices get better at placing AR objects, these annotations will become an even more powerful tool for remote guidance and collaboration. LiDAR will also increase the accuracy of AR Remote measurements, which allow users to record real-world measurements directly into a relevant case file. With greater accuracy and a more powerful AR Toolkit, SightCall users will be able to expand their digital AR tools. As both AR and AI improve, the possibilities to automate instructions with guided steps to help resolve common issues becomes easier to implement. To put it simply, the value is not in the technology itself, but in the service proposition that the technology enables. Beyond simply making our existing features more powerful, LiDAR opens up the possibility of new features and applications. With the ability to add 3D data to photos and videos and produce 3D scans of spaces, the visual assistance market, lead by SightCall, will expand the boundaries of self-guided and remotely guided customer experience.

Though there\u2019s fear around what negative effects this could have on human capital, most companies are looking for artificial intelligence (AI) or augmented reality (AR) solutions to help them achieve a specific goal or drive process improvements. The solutions are more of an aid to existing processes rather than a replacement. Despite what science fiction movies suggest, these tools are only as capable and trained as the people who use them. There is no one-size-fits-all response to every company\u2019s needs. If you\u2019re looking to embrace virtual solutions for the first time or significantly scale up your company\u2019s AI or AR operations, your objective should be to find a product with maximum customization. There are four core questions to ask. What is your need? Because you may not be using virtual solutions for everything in your business, it\u2019s important to pinpoint the type and nature of the problem you\u2019re trying to solve. Every business will have what\u2019s called a pain point: a specific issue your customers regularly face, or as Merriam-Webster puts it, something that \u201cfrequently inconveniences or annoys customers.\u201d If you already know your pain point, consider if and how you\u2019re using data to track and measure it. Where is your starting point? It\u2019s important to choose a platform that can coexist with your current business processes and cause minimal disruption. The right solution will offer a variety of deployment options that meet your needs. Do you want to use stand-alone visual assistance in an app or WebRTC setting? Do you currently have your own app that you use for customer or technician support? If so, you should choose a visual assistance platform can integrate into your app via SDK making it simple to start a video call with the click of a button. If you have an existing field service management (FSM) or customer relationship management (CRM) tool, a visual assistance platform that integrates with these business tools will ensure a seamless workflow that makes adoption and scheduling easy for your employees. Not only should your visual assistance platform integrate into these systems, it should collect and share data directly with the CRM/FSM. This will provide you with a single source of intelligence you can leverage to learn about your customers and their video usage with limitless possibilities. Which key performance indicators (KPIs) are you looking to improve? This partly ties into the first question and the reflection you\u2019ll make on your pain points. You\u2019ll also want to focus on enhancing the most important metrics that truly drive your business. Literally anything in your operations can be improved or built upon, but hitting specific targets results in the greatest success. As is often said, it\u2019s important to focus on the critical few, not the trivial many. Once you have established the most important KPIs needing improvement, you\u2019ll be able to further narrow down the must-have features of your virtual assistance solution. Maybe it\u2019s close integration with your CRM software, or a tool that works on your own devices and can be taken anywhere you need it to go, regardless of cellular connectivity or low bandwidth. How much flexibility are you looking for? In other words, should your virtual assistance solution respond to your needs, or your company to the capabilities (and limitations) of the tool you choose? Our goal at SightCall is to help you digitally transform your service organizations. To do this, we aim to provide you with the ability to leverage our capabilities to fit your objectives. Customization works across all of our system integrations, from Salesforce to ServiceMax, ZenDesk to Guidewire, Symbility and more. And, if you\u2019ve developed your own CRM software, our Custom Microservice architecture adds SightCall visual support to your existing system with the same ease. SightCall\u2019s Visual Support mobile application benefits from a high level of flexibility, adapted to respond to whichever settings you configure in the admin portal. To give one example, SightCall video sessions can be designed to launch with one-way video through the back camera of the user\u2019s smartphone or tablet, or with a two-way video session using the front camera. During the session, users can switch to either option at any time. If you already have existing mobile apps, SightCall is easily integrated into it \u2013 and with your company\u2019s branding. Using the mobile software development kit (SDK), this involves putting a video assistance button within the app, thereby increasing its value proposition to your customers by being able to offer them this feature. The webRTC web console is just as readily customized. In addition to choosing your color, feature selections and logo, the page can also augment your existing web applications through integration into an iFrame. Top-notch portability is an added plus. Besides GDPR and CCPA compliance, and HIPAA compatibility for clients in the healthcare space, our web console works in eight languages, with the mobile visual support app working in 13. More than any individual feature, the right visual assistance tool will place the greatest number of options right into your hands, for you to shape as you need them.

Operating in the \u201cnew normal\u201d, service organizations now understand they can\u2019t return to their old ways of working and be successful. The new state of the world requires digital transformation and the adoption of remote work to ensure overall business survival. At SightCall, we\u2019ve seen three distinct stages emerge when embarking on a business transformation journey in response to COVID-19. Stage 1 \u2013 protect your people and customers and enable a new way of working Stage 2 \u2013 enable a shift in business processes to allow for this new way of working Stage 3 \u2013 understand the implications of the new normal on your business and keep focused on delivering key priorities as well as keeping customers top of mind We recently attended Field Service Connect with our customer, a global leader in industrial printing, and discussed with him how his company is using remote visual assistance to improve worker efficiency, drive profitability and deliver business continuity during the ongoing pandemic. They are an organization at the very start of their digital transformation journey- a journey that has been accelerated significantly due to COVID-19. SightCall: How has your company been affected by COVID-19 and how have you adapted as a business? Customer: We were categorized as an essential supplier during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. As the pandemic hit China first, we were able to leverage the learnings from our Chinese colleagues and adapt our other business locations around the world accordingly. We already had a remote support capability in place, but knew we needed to accelerate a wider investment into AR-powered remote visual support to keep our people and customers safe and operate effectively. By quickly implementing SightCall we were able to put remote visual assistance at the forefront of our strategy. SightCall: Are there any specific use cases or examples you can share that demonstrate this? Customer: We have plenty. One that springs to mind is a large customer in Italy who is supported by their distributor. They had an issue that would have normally needed an on-site engineer to fix. They leveraged our AR remote support to show the issue live and the remote engineer was able to annotate and guide the customer to make the necessary changes and fix the issue, without needing to visit the site. Pre-COVID this issue would have taken 3-4 days to fix as we would have had to arrange for an engineer to travel to the location. By using SightCall, they fixed the issue in just a couple of hours. Another example is from a customer who is in a very noisy environment on site. They were open to using our AR remote support but couldn\u2019t actually hear the engineer. The engineer was able to annotate images and guide the customer visually to get the issue fixed. Again, we eliminated the need to organize an on-site visit, and the issue was fixed immediately. SightCall: How have you been driving adoption around remote support with your engineers and your customers? What challenges have you come up against and how have you overcome them? Customer: Whenever we roll out new technology, we think about two things- the internal customer and the external customer. We want to have an open and honest feedback loop with our internal users and customers at all times. During our pilot with SightCall, we surveyed our customers at the end of each day. Did SightCall provide value to you? Were you able to resolve the issue and if so, was it resolved faster than normal? 70% of survey results from our internal customers came back as very positive and we had a 76 NPS scoring from external customers, which we found very encouraging. We\u2019ve focused on developing training programs for our internal staff, which includes an e-learning program available in our Training Academy. All engineers and help desk agents joining the company must complete that training on the day they start. This helps us drive adoption internally and allows our engineers to become familiar with the AR remote support technology from the very start of their tenure with us. SightCall: The relationship between your engineers and your customers has probably changed- can you describe that change and how you\u2019ve adapted and invested in new skills? Customer: You\u2019re right, it has changed. As mentioned, we have focused on developing excellent training programmes around our AR remote support, but we are also investing in the soft skills of our engineers. This looks more closely at how our engineers interact with our customers, so we\u2019re providing them with the best possible service at all times. In addition, we want to educate our customers on the power of AR remote support, so that when we offer them this service it isn\u2019t completely alien to them. We\u2019re also conscious that we\u2019re a global company and the types of training, and how we deliver that training, will differ slightly in different locations across the world.

Embracing a simple add-on feature might hobble your efforts at digital transformation and keep your organization from leveraging the full benefits of video assistance. Here are some things to consider: Workflow First and foremost, it is vital that the visual assistance platform you adopt will integrate into your existing workflow. This means the visual assistance tool must fit into the application the service delivery team is using every day \u2013 whether that\u2019s a CRM, FSM, or trouble ticketing system. Ideally, the visual assistance should be launched from within the platform of record. SightCall integrates into Salesforce, ServiceNow, ServiceMax, and Zendesk. We also have custom microservice integration allowing us to integrate into any proprietary system, eliminating barriers to providing remote video assistance within any system. Data Integration Integrating visual assistance into your existing systems not only streamlines the process of launching or joining a video assistance call, but it also prevents data from being unnecessarily siloed. You\u2019ll want to be able to generate reports and look at statistics of your video assistance calls the same way you look at everything else. SightCall provides data integrations that give organizations a full, end-to-end view of their data for BI and obtain actionable details. Combining SightCall and business data allows you to quickly calculate things like ROI and cost savings. You can see the full benefits of adding visual assistance to your workflow as well as cross-reference existing data to gain numerous high-level business insights. Branding and Customization Customers\u2019 expectations for digital experiences are growing quickly. Delivering video assistance helps you differentiate your brand from your competitors. Making sure that the video assistance platform is useful and easy for everyone involved speaks volumes about your services and products. Branding your customer service is just as important as anything else. SightCall offers the flexibility to offer a fully branded, white-glove support service with the option to create a custom-branded app matched with your exact brand specifications. When insurance giant Allianz partnered with SightCall they digitally transformed their entire claims process. Their branded and customized user experience ensured a seamless adoption, and they have since used the platform to process over 100,000 remote video claims and saved their adjusters from driving over 6.3 million kilometers in unnecessary travel. Flexibility You need to make sure that the video assistance technology you use can be configured to the specific use cases that fit your model. Having too many unneeded features can be just as off-putting to users as having too few. And most organizations will need tailored experiences for at least a few different use cases. Adopting a platform with a variety of features that can be tailored to your needs will always be more successful than using a single out-of-the-box solution. SightCall is highly configurable and can be tailored to fit your specific needs. SightCall helps you identify use cases, each with a template used to enable or configure all the features and tools that can be used in a SightCall session. These use cases can be defined to fit precisely into the specific needs of any organization. For example, a business that does inspections can enable a subset of features specifically for that task. The same business might also do repairs, which they can easily set up to access a different set of features to easily facilitate their remote assistance for those cases. Change Management Providing services over video is not a matter of simply adding video to your existing model. You cannot simply turn on video and expect your team to be successful. It requires additional skills and using it well leads to many additional benefits. When Costa Express partnered with SightCall to power their digital transformation using visual assistance, their technical advisors have experienced a 79% increase in first call resolution through their helpline, solving 50% of issues at source since deploying SightCall. It\u2019s worth taking the time to choose and build a system that will bring more value to the organization and reduce unnecessary truck rolls in the field. SightCall has a success team that helps organizations to be successful with SightCall, including assisting with training and onboarding, reviewing your business goals, and setting up KPIs to measure them, managing customer usage to ensure your SightCall configuration is meeting your needs, and generally assist with anything you need. If you are ready to digitally transform your business with remote video assistance be sure to choose a vendor that will help you to be successful. Start off small, don\u2019t try to \u201cboil the ocean\u201d and tackle too many problems at once. Establish success with one use case before expanding into other areas of your business. With the right partner, implementing visual assistance can be incredibly beneficial. To learn more, contact our team of experts to discuss your visual assistance needs.

The COVID-19 pandemic has created new challenges for almost every organization, but it\u2019s also created new opportunities to change and improve the way field and customer service organizations do business. We\u2019ve seen the growth of new use cases for remote visual support evolve quite considerably since the onset of COVID-19, as organizations look to adapt, maintain and improve their service levels. We\u2019ve seen retail organizations deliver quality sales experiences despite the need for social distancing. Our customer Lincoln has met the need of stay-at-home shoppers by using remote visual support to provide a one-on-one virtual vehicle walk-around experience. A completely new way of doing business that they hadn\u2019t considered pre-COVID-19 and one that allows them to leverage their existing Lincoln Experience Centres that would have otherwise seen lower footfall during a time of social distancing and restrictions. Service organizations are now using remote visual support to train and educate their engineers and technicians. Our customer GE Healthcare has expanded into clinical education through remote visual support. They are now implementing remote component training for customers and clinicians. This has been especially critical to new clinicians using complex technology for the first time during the pandemic, where receiving in-person training and education hasn\u2019t been possible. We recently attended the Copperberg Virtual Aftermarket Summit with our customers KONE and Malvern Panalytical. We had an interesting discussion with them around some of the ways they\u2019ve been using remote visual support during the pandemic. KONE, the global leader in the elevator and escalator industry, currently operates across 60 different countries worldwide. The business previously offered remote support by email and phone but quickly realized they had to improve this in order to operate effectively. New regulations, masks, and social distancing have greatly affected how the business can maintain its equipment this year. By having remote visual support in place and integrated into their business processes long before COVID-19 hit, KONE has been able to effectively service their fleet of escalators and elevators, while keeping their engineers safe. Malvern Panalytical, a global manufacturer and supplier of laboratory analytical instruments, has seen some mission-critical examples of how important remote visual support is. The organization recently had to help one of their global customers using remote visual support, for the installation of a complex X-Ray machine in Iraq. The machine could only be installed by local support technicians due to strict travel restrictions that meant sending an expert on-site was just not possible. Through remote visual support, experts at their Netherlands base could effectively guide the customer through the complex installation process using live video and photo upload, annotations, and document sharing to successfully install the critical piece of machinery. Remote visual support is now so much more in the \u201cnew normal\u2019- it\u2019s giving our customers alternative access to maintain equipment and connect with customers while offering new and unique ways of training employees, supporting the sales process, auditing for quality assurance, and offering pre-visit inspections.

Read the original article here. For nearly 200 years, Bureau Veritas has ensured the safety of the shipping industry through testing, inspection and certification. However, the rise of the global COVID-19 pandemic left this age-old industry faced a brand-new challenge. \u201cThe process of inspections and classification has remained very traditional, based on human expertise\u201d says Vincent Joly, Digital Solutions Manager at Bureau Veritas Marine & Offshore. \u201cBefore the context of COVID-19, while we were very advanced in developing remote capabilities \u2013 and a good thing, too \u2013 no one could have imagined the accelerated requirements to switch to remote service delivery.\u201d While unexpected, Bureau Veritas took the challenge the pandemic presented and used it as an opportunity to usher help intensify the transition to a new era for the shipping industry\u2014fully remote and digital surveys. At the onset of the pandemic, the primary challenge facing surveyors was how to transition the critical, in-person work to remote with shipmanagers who were not prepared. Operations could not stop as hundreds of ships needed to be surveyed daily to assess damages, safety and ensure environmental protection. To add an additional layer of difficulty, the restrictions and regulations varied significantly across countries as they all responded differently to the rise in COVID-19 cases. To ensure they could remain operational, Bureau Veritas turned to digital classification supported through innovative services including SightCall, an AR-enabled visual assistance platform. \u201cUsing SightCall, we call the master of the ship or the superintendent of the company to initiate a session without sending a surveyor onboard,\u201d says Joly of the platform that they chose for this transformation. Once the call is initiated, the client uses real time video communication to show the surveyor the item that needs to be inspected. They can verify documentation onboard, look at the hull or check a leak through their mobile device. The platform works in an offline mode so that the client can take photos and videos below deck then share that media in a live stream with a surveyor when back above deck. The surveyor can make annotations, take high resolution images and still perform the inspection using the media the client provides. As the pandemic continues on and some industries are starting on the path to recovery, Bureau Veritas says that remote surveys will continue to be a part of their business as AR-enabled visual assistance has proven to have several benefits. According to Joly, \u201cIt\u2019s better for the planet, less costly for the client and safer for the surveyor. We can generate evidence faster. We have better occupancy of the surveyor and they can perform more surveys, because they are spending less time traveling.\u201d Reducing its carbon footprint has long been a goal of Bureau Veritas and many others in maritime. Remote operations make this goal even closer. Many in supply chain feel the pressures of a need for a more sustainable future and found that digital transformation helps answer that call. When asked about continuing to push the industry beyond its centuries-old practices, Joly believes there\u2019s opportunity for continued innovation. \u201cThrough remote operation and SightCall we can generate more data, like pictures and videos, to build new models in AI and enable additional value and services. We are excited about the possibilities of new services and new deliverables in the future with real-time communication tools. We will still need surveyors on ships but we now have an additional and crucial capability to take us into the future.\u201d Don\u2019t Let Years of Wisdom Walk Out the Door Connect with us today to build a plan for capturing knowledge and reducing revenue loss Get a Demo Get Connected!

View the original article here. Digitizing expert advice and services is more important than ever, with this phenomenon innovating practices in the food industry. Verifying that food safety practices are being held to the highest standards is integral to the global food system and human health. And while food safety relies on straightforward principles, its verification requires a complex system of specialists and auditors to ensure processes are practiced consistently and appropriately to mitigate risks of microbial or chemical contamination. With Covid-19 curbing travel and in-person interaction, physical audits of food production environments have been challenged. Certification bodies, like GlobalG.A.P. and trade associations like United Fresh, are working with their members to navigate meeting food safety verification needs while keeping auditors and personnel safe. And even though auditing is more difficult now, physical visits are still occurring. \u201cIn the United States, the vast majority of producers are choosing to keep on-site audits as part of their food safety verification practices,\u201d said Rebecca Anderson from GlobalG.A.P. \u201cTo ensure everyone\u2019s safety during on site-audits, auditors are wearing Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), taking temperature checks before stepping foot onto a farm, practicing social distancing, and other proactive measures.\u201d With the necessity of physical audits in some scenarios, personnel are using social distancing modifications along with PPE to accomplish their checking and verification requirements. But increasingly, the food industry are finding hybrid and remote auditing arrangements effective, utilizing commonly available tools like Zoom, FaceTime, and Google Duo with this toe-dip into digital tools for auditing, it may be expected that augmented/mixed reality may come into play, but it\u2019s important to realize ease of use and practicality are above all the most important factors for effective tools. According to Dr. Emily Griep, Manager of Food Safety at United Fresh, \u201cAuditors have explored hi-tech options like Google Glass, but it\u2019s more common for virtual tours to be conducted through apps like Facetime, Zoom, and Google Duo. Rural growing regions can have limited bandwidth, in which case, auditors may ask for photos of certain production practices or areas and will conduct interviews over the phone.\u201d Anderson reaffirmed the importance of a strong internet connection and that it can be difficult to come by in some remote farming locations. Remote auditing also reduces the environmental impacts of auditors ongoing plane travel as well as the limiting negative impacts to their personal lives and career longevity. As many in the food industry can concur, effective auditors quickly move up and out as their skillset allows them to choose better work/life balance opportunities. When asked about the role of emerging technologies in remote auditing, Anderson added \u201cRemote auditing and food safety can be supported by augmented reality (AR) and IoT in multiple ways. Some examples include water antimicrobial levels, product location with time stamping, field irrigation sensors and tracking, locations of pest intrusions\u202fand pesticide applications, harvest information, pathogen testing results, and other types of production monitoring. Many programs available can not only record, but also aggregate\u202fand analyze these types of data to inform\u202fbetter managerial decisions.\u201d It\u2019s important to note that this represents a shift in thinking from periodic checks to constant monitoring and recordkeeping of food safety indicators. For thinking beyond simple videoconferencing toward utilizing multiple digital tools in rural and remote settings, SightCall is an enterprise-grade video cloud platform that works with various industries including agriculture. Applications of their platform range across agriculture, from machine repair to inspections and quality safety. Their video offering differs from something like Zoom due to additional technology features, such as AR, geolocation, timestamps, and QR-code capabilities, showing the importance of data solutions being able to reach diverse geographies. \u201cWe are optimizing the way we can stream data, including video, in addition to other data from point A to point B, potentially in multi-point, in a secure, optimized manner,\u201d said Thomas Cottereau, CEO of SightCall. \u201cUsers have access to a vast amount of expertise and feedback. Not only can you have video discussions, but you have insight that you can give life to.\u201d Looking ahead, both Dr. Griep and Anderson believe that virtual audits will continue beyond the Covid-19 pandemic. Enhanced data analytics and information gathering will increasingly look at ways of prioritizing high risk scenarios for physical audits while using virtual audits to increase efficiency, reduce environmental impact, and improve livelihoods. \u201cSo far, we have every reason to have high levels of confidence in\u202fremote audits. This confidence is shared by the vast majority of stakeholders including our organization, Certification Bodies and their auditors, producers and importantly, the companies buying produce and other crops from the farmers undergoing remote audits.\u201d said Anderson. \u201cIn light of the FDA\u2019s New Era of Smarter Food Safety plan, producers and customers alike should embrace new approaches to food safety verification,\u201d added Dr. Griep.

As a result, we often rely on the assistance of experts to help address our problems. This can be for something as simple as resetting a microwave timer after a power outage or as complex as diagnosing industrial manufacturing equipment. The experts that help us are doing more than waiting by the phone. They are often working inside CRM and trouble ticketing systems like Salesforce and Zendesk to manage incoming requests for assistance. Sometimes experts receive requests for assistance that require a deeper level of investigation than email, chat, or telephone can provide. Five years ago, the expert would have sent a technician onsite to troubleshoot the problem, but today many issues can be resolved through video. Live video assistance enables an expert to have an actual view of a customer\u2019s problem and the context of the issue. This empowers them to quickly resolve tickets that may have previously needed onsite support. Having disparate systems for visual assistances and a CRM or trouble ticketing system can lead to challenges. Primarily the experts using these tools every day will experience frustration from having to jump back and forth between these systems and copying and pasting data to synchronize the information between the two systems. The last thing we want is for the expert delivering support to need to contact support themselves to help figuring out multiple tools. To make your experts more effective and efficient you need to look for visual support tools that have an integrated workflow with your CRM or trouble ticketing system. It\u2019s important to ensure ease of use for your experts but also consistency in reporting and data. The SightCall platform was designed with integration in mind. With the core platform wrapped in a rich set of APIs it becomes very easy to integrate SightCall into virtually other system. In fact, we have a collection of apps which are turn-key integrations. Organizations that use Salesforce can leverage the SightCall for Salesforce app to enable an integrated workflow for Service Cloud, Field Service Lightning, and Health Cloud. We also have an app that enables chat escalation to a visual assistance call from the Salesforce Einstein chat bot. We also have apps that enable integration with ServiceNow and Zendesk. What if you use a different system for managing customers, trouble tickets, or work orders? You can still use SightCall and have workflow integration. We have created an architecture that enables SightCall to be easily integrated with virtually any backend system. We leverage a microservice architecture that is customized for each backend system we integrate with. The best part of the custom microservice we offer is that no developers are required. At least you don\u2019t need developers. The custom microservice offering includes the customization work needed to integrate SightCall into your backend system. So, you don\u2019t need to load your precious developers time building the integration. We can take care of it for you. Best of all, we also host the custom microservice integration in SightCall datacenters, so your IT staff don\u2019t have to manage another system. The custom microservice integration approach enables the deep integration needed to make SightCall a part of your support experts\u2019 daily workflow. It also enables deeper insights in your business intelligence system, integration into your contact center ACD, and much more.

At AP\u2019s Technical Support Center in Sioux City, Iowa, the walls are lined with working models of all controller systems produced and sold by AP over the last 30 years. With any incoming customer call, the staff can use the appropriate piece of equipment to troubleshoot the situation, eliminating the need for a dealer or technician to visit the producer\u2019s operation. \u201cThis setup is really unique in the pork industry, and it\u2019s especially important in the current health environment,\u201d says Mark Oberreuter, tech team manager. \u201cAP has always had a strong focus on customer service, and recent advancements in remote monitoring technology have enabled us to further strengthen that commitment.\u201d For producers who use AP\u2019s advanced EDGE controller, first introduced in 2015, the tech team can link to the customer unit anywhere in the world via the Internet, whether to help diagnose and address an environmental issue or to simply offer assistance with controller settings. If a producer has a controller prior to EDGE, the tech team can access the exact same model from the center\u2019s walls to resolve the issue by phone or video chat. Oberreuter added that tech staff support is supplemented by AP\u2019s full library of training videos which producers and others can access at any time. New remote video assistance The Sioux City team is also using a new remote video assistance tool called SightCall. This software allows a tech to view what a customer shows via their smartphone and then interact with the image shown on the screen. The tool utilizes a Telestrator-like device that enables the tech member to draw a freehand sketch over a moving or still video image. \u201cThis tool is yet another way that remote service can help keep hog facilities safe and clean,\u201d Oberreuter says. \u201cThe current pandemic has prompted us to move even faster with new advancements that will enable us to serve customers even better into the future.\u201d Read the full article here.

Should You Use WebRTC For Customer Support? SightCall WebRTC is a browser technology that makes it possible to have a real-time video call from within your web browser. WebRTC streamlines the process of getting a user to join a call by eliminating the need to download or install any software. This makes it seem like an ideal technology for uses such as customer support where the customer joins a call by simply clicking a link in a web page. However, WebRTC does have limitations compared with natively installed apps. Before choosing a video platform, it\u2019s important to determine how you will use live video to provide customer support. What type of device do you anticipate your customer to use while engaged in a troubleshooting session? If your company is primarily dealing with desktop software, it is safe to assume your customer will be connecting from the very PC or Mac they are running your application on. However, if you are providing support on machinery or equipment of some kind, you are will likely have customers connecting from their mobile device. WebRTC tends to perform well on desktop or laptop computers but mobile can be a challenge. Computers often have excess CPU to provide good quality audio and video encode capability. However, on mobile devices the story isn\u2019t quite the same. Mobile devices have many more constraints than a computer. They operate off battery power and thus the hardware has been designed to conserve power consumption often at the expense of computing resources. Additionally, mobile devices operate over wireless networks which are inherently unstable. Another important factor to consider is video performance. When video performance is high you get a better picture, smoother motion, and a more pleasing experience. When using WebRTC technology, you are reliant upon the performance of the video client that is contained in the web browser. Because no software is installed, the video engine in use is what the browser maker has created. This means it isn\u2019t possible to perform any optimizations on the video engine that would lead to better performance for the given use case. With a native application, the video client is under full control of the software maker and is free to tune the video engine for optimal performance. Additionally, a native video client has direct access to the hardware it is running on thus making it possible to adapt and adjust to the available resources better. In other words, you typically get better performance from a video client running natively rather than in the browser. When choosing between WebRTC and native apps, there are other considerations than just audio and video quality. For example, there may be certain features that your usage might require. You compare the availability of those features in all the browsers you wish to support. WebRTC is not fully implemented on every browser. If you want to give your users a certain feature, what will you do if one of your users is on a browser that does not support that feature? You can make the feature unavailable if the unsupported browser is being used, but this makes for an inconsistent experience. You could also prompt the user to install the supported browser, but this takes away one of the major benefits of WebRTC to begin with; eliminating the need to install new software. In order to provide a consistent user experience, you will find yourself balancing the need to restrict certain features or restricting certain browsers. With native apps it is much easier to create a consistent user experience between devices. From the table we can see that the native app tends to win for most considerations with the exception of ease of joining. This is a very important consideration. If someone is unable to join a call they will not be able to get the needed support. However, most users are accustomed to installing apps for needed services. You need to decide if the benefits that come from a native app outweigh the convenience of no software installation. For the onetime call, WebRTC may be the right choice. However, if you have customers or field technicians who are routinely calling in for support, the benefits of native app are probably worth the effort of app installation. In conclusion, the choice between WebRTC or a native app comes down to the unique needs of your organization. There is no \u201cone size fits all\u201d option for service, and your ultimate decision should be based on creating the best possible experience for your customer. Still have questions?

Without healthcare, infrastructure, manufacturing, and essential retail, our global economies and societies would collapse. We rely not only on the people who run these businesses and services, but also on the millions of field service workers that keep mission-critical utilities and equipment in operation. Collectively, SightCall customers receive hundreds of thousands of service incidents per month. On average, we help our customers resolve 55% of their SightCall work orders without the need for an onsite visit. Before 2020, I might have told you that the primary benefits of digitally transforming with live video were to provide a better service to the customer, improve the company\u2019s bottom line and empower employees. Today I would tell you that the stakes to convert onsite visits to visual support calls are critical to public health. There\u2019s no doubt that over the past few months you\u2019ve heard the term \u201cflatten the curve,\u201d but what does it mean? Flatten the curve is a term coined by Dr. Howard Markel, a University of Michigan medical historian. When studying past pandemics, Dr. Markel and his colleagues found that throughout history, cities that took drastic measures to curb contact could reduce the spike (curve) in infections and stretch them out (flatten) over a longer period of time. By this logic, we have to assume that every truck roll, doctor appointment, or in-person customer interaction that can be converted to a phone call, online chat or visual support session will reduce the possibility of spreading coronavirus and help to flatten the curve. For early adopters of digital transformation, this challenge has been surmountable. For service organizations that have been slow to change, COVID-19 has presented a huge challenge that must be addressed now. All service organizations must find a way to maintain field service operations while mitigating the risk associated with contact. Visual Support Reduces Technicians in the Field The right visual support tool can reduce trips to the field by half. When a technician can see the problem before going onsite, they are more likely to: identify if the issue is simple user error; determine if the issue can be fixed through remote guidance; determine exactly what parts will be needed to resolve the issue; or decide if the issue requires a product replacement rather than fix. See how Koenig & Bauer uses SightCall to improve fix rates and help their customers resolve complex issues remotely. Visual Support Reduces the Need for Person- to-Person Contact Some service requests do not require a trained expert to be deployed to the field. There are tasks that can be guided and performed by a person onsite, even if that person is not an employee of your company. Cable providers can rely on customers to help them see if a modem needs a reset or a total replacement. Insurers are able to expedite their claims process from weeks to days by handling claims remotely with customers. Retailers can walk customers through user errors reducing the need for product returns or onsite visits. SightCall empowers your support team to see the issue and provide a diagnosis in real-time. Visual Support Improves Uptime for Essential Equipment Due to travel bans and quarantine, it is not always possible to send the most qualified technician out in the field. Visual assistance empowers a remote expert to guide an onsite technician through a complex repair process. SightCall provides a robust suite of tools in a collaborative digital environment that allows two technicians to interact as if they were in the same location. Features like Augmented Reality (AR) annotations, live pointer and document share make it easy for technicians to work in harmony and fix problems as a team. See how GE Healthcare uses SightCall to keep mission-critical medical devices online with remote visual assistance. Visual Support Can Ensure Business Continuity In February 2020 when the coronavirus outbreak hit Italy, the Italian government set up red zones to establish travel to and from the outbreak epicenters. This prevented A&A Italia, a loss adjusting and third-party claims administrator, from sending insurance adjusters to support customers with claims for an indefinite period of time. A&A was able to use SightCall to provide continued service to their customers and the insured. A&A agents safely processed customer claims from home or office with no need to go onsite. The insured were pleased that the claims process could be handled remotely, respecting their safety, without an agent having to visit their home. With visual assistance, A&A was able to continue business operations and take care of their customers and employees. \u201cSince 2017, A&A Italia has used SightCall to serve customers in 40% of insurance claims. Once Coronavirus became a major public health concern, we knew that SightCall was the only tool that would allow adjusters to continue their work safely from home. Due to the crisis our customers are reluctant, and sometimes unable, to allow adjusters into their home. Visual Support enabled us to maintain close contact with the insured while respecting government restrictions. Being the first adopter of visual claims in Italy made it easier for us to adjust in the wake of this epidemic.\u201d \u2013 Elisabetta Pinciroli Managing Director, A&A Italia As of March 25, 2020, there are 458,000 cases of confirmed Coronavirus reported globally, and that number continues to grow. It is our prerogative to deploy digital technologies, in addition to other health precautions and safety measures, that allow us to continue business operations while protecting our employees, customers and global community. Coronavirus is spreading rapidly due to our connected world, it is also our connected world that can help to stop it. Together we can flatten the curve and protect our essential workers and healthcare providers until there is a treatment. Contact us for more information on SightCall visual assistance.

You already know that a single bad service experience can undo months, even years, of hard work. You\u2019ve read the numbers. Your team knows what\u2019s at stake. That\u2019s why, as an enterprise service leader, you\u2019re looking for\u2026 A faster way to get customers from frustrated to grateful A better way to get technicians unstuck when they get stumped on-site A more efficient (and accurate) upgrade for legacy processes and manual tasks Your organization wants a solution that works and plays well with the software and systems that you\u2019re already using. You need to move the metrics needle fast with a platform that can deploy in weeks instead of months. Because hitting those quarterly KPIs wasn\u2019t just a friendly suggestion from your company leadership. It sounds like you need a bold new way of working. It sounds like you need SightCall VISION. What is SightCall Vision? \u201c SightCall VISION is more than just a technological advancement; it\u2019s a new way of working,\u201d said SightCall CEO Thomas Cottereau. \u201cIt\u2019s a more VISUAL way of working. Simply stated, SightCall VISION is a visual software platform for enterprise service providers. It helps you see more to solve faster and serve better. It leverages a suite of visual technologies including AR -enabled live video, digital process automation, and multimodal generative AI. Each helps you create a more intuitive and less complicated way of working. And that improved perspective speeds understanding, reduces errors and saves time that would have been spent searching, waiting, talking or traveling. At its core, SightCall VISION addresses a common challenge: the disconnect between the high level of service customers expect and what enterprises can realistically provide. Your business needs are unique, complex and likely hard to sum up in a few hundred words. The same goes for SightCall VISION. Of course, the best way to see what the platform does (and what it can do for you) is to schedule a free demo. But in the meantime, let\u2019s take a quick look at the big things you need to know about SightCall VISION \u2026 1. Visual Service is More Effective Why is visual service more effective? Because humans are hard-wired for seeing: 90% of information is processed using sight 65% of human beings are visual learners The brain processes images 60,000 times faster than text Think of the saying, \u201cA picture is worth 1000 words.\u201d If every second counts, why waste 7.5 minutes explaining something that an image could convey in an instant? (the average speaking rate is 125-150 words per minute) If your challenge is solving customer problems or providing expert support to technicians in the field, visual service makes more sense. Adding SightCall VISION to your current service stack is like taking off a blindfold or switching on the lights in a dark room. We believe it works as a powerful lever to lower costs and boost revenue where it matters most. And we can prove it. 2. SightCall VISION Moves the Metrics That Matter Empowering your teams to see and solve challenges in real-time, opens doors to unprecedented operational efficiency and customer satisfaction. SightCall has been at this for a while. While our start was in remote live video support, SightCall has evolved over the last decade by leaps and bounds in response to the changing needs of our clients. \u201cTechnology is moving very fast. It\u2019s our job to make sure we are leveraging the most innovative tools and solutions,\u201d said SightCall COO, Ronan Souberbielle. \u201cBut it\u2019s about more than just technology, it\u2019s the application of that technology to fulfill specific business needs and achieve tangible outcomes for our clients. That\u2019s where SightCall makes a difference.\u201d Our global clients see remarkable results every day with Visual Assistance: 50% fewer truck rolls 81% jump in first-time fix rate 69% reduction in resolution time And some of the biggest changes can be seen in customer satisfaction, with significant boosts in scores like NPS and CSAT, as well as jumps in the overall quality of customer experience. Giving your customers the ability to be heard AND seen helps them feel connected and understood. They will appreciate not hearing \u201cWho are you?\u201d and \u201cWhat\u2019s the problem?\u201d on an endless loop. SightCall VISION can help you rewrite the traditional service script. It replaces repetitive queries with insightful, guided experiences. \u201cI SEE where you\u2019ve been. Let me SHOW you how to solve this issue,\u201d becomes the new service mantra. 3. Four Important Words Sum Up SightCall VISION See. Analyze. Guide. Report. Those four simple words form the heart of what our platform can do. That\u2019s why we\u2019re so excited about the combination of augmented reality (AR), video assistance, and multimodal generative AI-enhanced computer vision in a unified enterprise platform. Think of the field technician, alone and stumped in front of an industrial printing machine that needed to be online two hours ago. Think of the woman heading to work who expected her coffee machine to fill a travel mug with coffee but got a blinking red error light instead. Think of the family in Iceland whose pipes burst after midnight in the middle of a winter storm. The only thing that matters to each of them? A fast and simple solution to their problem. SightCall VISION is there, at the moment of service, to help customers, technicians, agents and experts SEE issues clearer to solve them faster. The technician can view the printer using augmented reality, he can instantly connect to add the eyes of a remote expert, or he can utilize advanced Computer Vision AI that can help ANALYZE the issue. The decaffeinated woman can use her smartphone to connect to customer service, take a photo of her coffee machine and receive instant assistance in the form of digital instructions, videos or both, as well as a live remote GUIDE taking her step-by-step through the troubleshooting process. The family in Iceland can upload photos, videos and key insurance information immediately instead of waiting for an adjuster to arrive on site. SightCall VISION accelerates the claims process and a full, multimedia REPORT can be created with generative AI. Smart, visual software like SightCall VISION empowers your people, uncomplicates your processes and can transform service from a cost center to a revenue builder. 4. SightCall VISION is the Enemy of Waste Money. Time. Carbon. Effort. When it comes to different kinds of waste, SightCall VISION has no favorites. It dislikes them all. \u201cCreating a more visual way to work helps eliminate waste in almost every way,\u201d said CEO Thomas Cottereau. \u201cIn the environment, in the product, in efficiency and even by preventing the waste of energy that people spend in search of solutions.\u201d SightCall VISION helps field service organizations reduce carbon emissions by eliminating unnecessary truck rolls. For busy customer service contact centers, VISION saves valuable agent time by increasing call deflection and improving first-call resolution. The productivity gains you\u2019ll see by upgrading from traditional service tools like paper forms or disconnected legacy systems? Huge. One of our favorite features of SightCall VISION is how it saves time for customers and technicians by getting them key information exactly where (and when) it\u2019s needed. Companies can have massive knowledge bases, but that knowledge is worthless if it can\u2019t be quickly found by customers and service teams. If the answers to questions aren\u2019t readily accessible to technicians on site or customers faced with product issues\u2026 are they really answers at all? 5. SightCall VISION is Ready to Change the Way You Work In an era of rising customer expectations and evolving technology, enterprise companies need to open their eyes to stay ahead. Service teams stuck using the old tools of voice, chat, and paper forms are flying blind\u2026 and leaving their customers in the dark. Long ago, vision provided early humans with an evolutionary advantage. The ability to see clearly helped us identify dangers and opportunities. We could avoid poison berries and spot camouflaged predators. Vision helped us understand our environment and develop relationships. It helped us solve problems. Today, SightCall VISION seeks to offer a similar evolutionary edge to enterprise service teams, with a dynamic platform that enhances, expands, and extends your service organization\u2019s field of vision. We know that digital transformation doesn\u2019t happen with the flip of a switch. We know that rethinking the way your organization works is a complicated journey that is sometimes easier to take one step at a time. But we also know that the world is changing fast. Technology is evolving. Customers expect more. And companies are struggling with how to do more with less. That\u2019s why, there\u2019s never been a better time to prepare your business for tomorrow than today.

By now, you\u2019ve probably encountered or used generative AI tools in your professional or personal life. You may have observed that many of these tools are limited in the kinds of data they can process and the outputs they generate. From ChatGPT for text applications to Midjourney and DALL-E for images, most AI tools employ single-modal generative AI, which means they can manage only one data type\u2014be it text, image, video, or audio. But with the continuous evolution of technology, AI solutions are emerging that can manage multiple data types and sources simultaneously. These solutions are known collectively as multimodal generative AI. Multimodal Generative AI: Breaking it Down Imagine a technology that perceives the world much like humans do, using multiple \u201csenses\u201d in conjunction with each other to perceive and understand the world. Multimodal AI can combine and interpret multiple data inputs to create a more nuanced and humanlike understanding of the information presented to it. This includes data (or modes) such as video, images, speech, sound, and text. In essence, multimodal AI systems are composed of three main components. Input Module: Contains a series of unimodal neural networks, each responsible for handling a specific modal data type. Fusion Module: Combines and connects the data from the input module, using the strengths of each modality (text, images, video, audio) to create a comprehensive, structured data set. Output Module: Generates the desired content in multimodal format, combining text, images, video, and audio to make predictions, decisions, or recommendations that a human can then use in the real world. Multimodal generative AI isn\u2019t just a fancy term. It\u2019s bridging gaps that single-modal generative AI can\u2019t, forging new avenues and opportunities for enterprise service organizations. \u201cCustomer service is the second highest area seeing adoption of generative AI among businesses, just behind information technology.\u201d \u2013 Gartner Related Read: Generative AI & Customer Service: 9 Things Contact Center Leaders Need to Know Multimodal Gen AI Applications in Enterprise Customer and Field Service Organizations Generative AI is quickly emerging as a key enabler behind the scenes of many enterprise-level customer service operations. And companies are devising ways for multimodal AI to make delivering high-quality service easier. Predictive Maintenance Equipment failure can result in significant downtime, costly repairs, and production loss. Companies are exploring how predictive maintenance, with the advent of AI, can transform the industrial landscape. For example, in the healthcare industry, hospitals rely on their equipment to be functional at a moment\u2019s notice to ensure they can provide timely care to their patients. From MRI machines to CT scanners to ventilators, health providers can\u2019t afford to have their equipment unavailable when their patients\u2019 health depends on it. Using systems powered by multimodal generative AI, diagnostic data from an equipment\u2019s sensors can be collected and analyzed simultaneously. The AI can correlate the information and predict potential issues, so hospitals can develop maintenance plans or equipment rotation schedules to ensure they are not hindered by device downtime. By combining and analyzing data from different modalities, the AI offers a more comprehensive view of a machine\u2019s health, enabling timely interventions. This not only reduces unplanned shutdowns, but also extends the lifespan of the equipment. Personalized Customer Interactions In the era of information overload, customers want interactions that feel unique to their preferences and needs. Imagine a retail website where, based on your past shopping behavior, product views, and even uploaded photos of your personal style, an AI suggests outfits and products tailored just for you. Soon enough, with multimodal generative AI, businesses will no longer be restricted to just analyzing textual data; they\u2019ll be able to leverage visual information to refine their understanding of each customer\u2019s preferences. And this goes beyond just offering product recommendations. For instance, in the not too distant future, a user will be able to upload a picture of their living room, and the AI will suggest furniture and decor that matches the style and layout, creating an immersive and customized shopping experience. Automated Customer Support Customer service centers are no stranger to repetitive queries that take up time and energy. By implementing multimodal AI solutions, service centers will be able to resolve common inquiries automatically. Simple customer problems get solved faster, freeing up agents to focus their attention on more complex issues. Consider a scenario where a customer snaps a picture of a malfunctioning appliance and uploads it to a company\u2019s service portal (along with a short description of the issue). Instead of the usual back-and-forth textual interaction, AI instantly recognizes the faulty part and either prompts the customer with step-by-step instructions, offers a multimedia repair guide or facilitates the ordering of a replacement, all within minutes. This solution expedites the support process and gets customers closer to a solution before ever connecting with a live agent. \u201c38% of businesses consider customer experience and retention to be the primary focus of their generative AI initiatives\u201d \u2013 Gartner Benefits of Multimodal Generative AI The seamless integration of various communication channels and data types is in the early days but evolving rapidly. Multimodal Generative AI stands at the forefront of this transformation, offering tangible benefits to customer service departments and field service operations in large enterprises. At SightCall, we are committed to helping our customers keep pace with rapid innovation. We think there are three primary advantages of integrating multimodal generative AI for your customer service and field service organizational practices: 1) Transformational Shifts in Customer Dynamics The digital customer is evolving. In this complex landscape, they seek immediacy, precision, and relevance. With multimodal generative AI, customer service departments are uniquely poised to bridge this expectation gap. It\u2019s more than just solving problems; it\u2019s about pre-empting them and crafting solutions that are tailor-made for each individual interaction. Soon multimodal gen AI will be able to help resolve customer problems faster and more accurately, while also providing more natural and personalized interactions, whether with a support agent or with an AI chatbot directly. These improvements can enhance the user experience while also increasing customer satisfaction and loyalty. 2) The Cost-Benefit Paradigm While the financial advantage of streamlining operations is evident, the less tangible \u2013 yet equally critical \u2013 benefit is the equity earned from demonstrating innovation leadership. Every dollar saved is a testament to operational efficiency, but every satisfied customer is an ambassador in the making. The infusion of multimodal generative AI is not just about saving; it\u2019s about investing in the future. In addition, automating repetitive processes and solutions reduces the need for human agents to handle these simpler tasks. This allows businesses to reallocate their human labor resources more effectively to higher value work that is more professionally fulfilling. 3) Positioning for the Future As services and products attract competitors and move toward commoditization, the differentiating factor will undeniably shift towards service excellence. By integrating multimodal generative AI, enterprises will be able to position themselves at the vanguard of this shift. It\u2019s not about keeping up with the competition; it\u2019s about redefining the playing field. With the customer service landscape increasingly becoming driven by AI, integrating multimodal generative AI into your workflow will help your business stay ahead of the curve and give you a competitive edge compared to other companies in your industry. \u201cFor service organizations that have adopted generative AI into their businesses, 54% reported seeing decreases in costs, and 57% reported seeing increases in revenue.\u201d \u2013 McKinsey Challenges and Considerations As with all technology, multimodal generative AI has its inherent risks and challenges to consider when deciding whether to adopt it into a company\u2019s business practices. Some of these risks include potential data confidentiality breaches, data privacy and security issues, AI misrepresentations (hallucinations), copyright concerns, and potential misuse. Despite these risks, 68% of IT executives believe that the benefits to be gained from generative AI outweigh its potential risks. (Gartner) For visionary customer service departments, the pressing question isn\u2019t whether to adopt generative AI, but when. The nexus of technology and strategy is already here, as are the experts who are ready to help you navigate and implement multimodal data sets and generative AI systems. By partnering with trusted AI technology leaders like SightCall, you and your company will be set up for sustained success in the decades to come. \u201cAccording to an April 2023 survey, 89% of polled companies are in the process of integrating generative AI into their business, with 19% already either piloting AI tools or actively using AI in production.\u201d \u2013 Gartner Don\u2019t Let Years of Wisdom Walk Out the Door Connect with us today to build a plan for capturing knowledge and reducing revenue loss Get a Demo Get Connected!

But that\u2019s where we are. We live in a world of convenience, driven by technology. There are plenty of numbers online showing more than 60% of customers prefer the DIY option. And an oft-cited study from The Harvard Business Review adds insult to injury by noting that 81% of people attempt to resolve an issue on their own before reaching out to a representative. This puts contact centers in an awkward position. After all, what is customer support without the support? What are we supposed to tell the dozens (or hundreds, or THOUSANDS) of human beings who are standing by to help? If everybody wants to resolve their own issues, what are we supposed to tell the agents? Welcome to the Self-Service Revolution For starters, you can tell them to buckle up and settle in. Self-service is the new normal. The revolution is here and it\u2019s not going anywhere anytime soon. Customers have been using technology to sort out their own questions for some time now, getting the help they need without always having to chat with a support agent. And it\u2019s a trend propelled by a growing consumer preference for swift, effective, and accessible solutions. Thanks to the boom in e-commerce, smartphone apps and intuitive UX, the buying public expects instant gratification at every step. Self-service comes in many forms, leveraging a wide range of tools and software platforms, including automated systems like chatbots and IVR, self-service web portals, comprehensive knowledge bases, and mobile applications, each designed to streamline customer interactions. Once upon a time, high-tech conveniences like virtual check deposits, remote video support and real-time shipment tracking were once differentiators. Today they\u2019re table stakes. Customers demand transparency, ease-of-use and speed. And companies who give it to them are reaping the rewards. This paradigm shift offers massive mutual benefits for businesses and consumers. Companies minimize operational costs and optimize human resources and customers get immediate, round-the-clock service and flexibility. And some of the most positive side effects can impact agents. Boosting Agent Efficiency by Empowering Customers Something exciting happens when you make it easy for customers to resolve simple queries and transactions. The flow of routine, repetitive tasks and requests that used to clog the gears of high-traffic call centers eases up. Instead of agents using valuable time to collect basic information (name, address, etc), pre-call solutions can do it automatically. Simple software workflows can prompt customers to submit that essential information, scan barcodes and serial numbers and provide an overview of their issue. Once the call is connected, the agent and customer can get straight to solving the problem. Self-service options can automate any simple sequence or service process that agents find themselves faced with over and over. It\u2019s become a running joke in the IT world, but sometimes a computer ISN\u2019T plugged in. Sometimes turning it off and then on again DOES fix the problem. Self-service can save your agents from repeating those more remedial requests. It can help them allocate more time and resources to complex, high-value interactions that require human empathy, judgment, and expertise. It\u2019s a win-win because agents get to engage in more rewarding and meaningful work and customers get a smoother and more efficient service experience. Beyond the Switch: Crafting Smart Self-Service for Smoother Journeys and Real Results The shift doesn\u2019t just happen with the flip of a switch. To really nail self-service, it\u2019s all about creating easy-to-use tools that are packed with solid info, plus keeping a human on standby for when things get tricky. We\u2019ve all been frustrated by an eager chatbot who promises to work miracles but then answers every question with a link to the support page. Waiting on hold has never been fun and nobody likes getting lost in an IVR maze. And these days, friction has become a four-letter word. The idea isn\u2019t to hand customers answers or instructions and wish them luck. The goal is to help them get as far as possible towards a solution and be there when (and if) they need help to cross the finish line. When executed well, a self-service strategy can create a virtuous cycle that improves almost every aspect of your customer service operation. With the growing popularity of self-service, traditional metrics of call center efficiency, such as Average Handling Time (AHT) and First Call Resolution (FCR), are evolving to fit new definitions of customer service effectiveness. There\u2019s a shift in focus to metrics that encompass the full customer journey across channels. This includes tracking the rate at which self-service tasks are completed, how many issues are resolved without needing an agent, and customer satisfaction scores (CSAT) specifically related to self-service interactions. We\u2019re all looking closer at Net Promoter Score (NPS) and Customer Effort Score (CES), which underscores a shift from purely operational efficiency towards a more holistic view of customer engagement and success. Elevating the Role of Agents: Transforming Customer Service from Routine to Remarkable Integrating self-service options helps businesses significantly shift the nature of work for their agents, moving them away from routine inquiries to concentrate on more complex and nuanced issues. Straightforward tasks such as account inquiries, payment processing, and basic troubleshooting, traditionally consumed a substantial portion of an agent\u2019s time. When customers leverage self-service for these simple tasks, agents are free to focus their skills on situations that require deeper insights, personalized attention, and problem-solving abilities. This leads directly to better service and higher job satisfaction among agents. It reduces monotony, enhances the sense of achievement and helps customer support professionals develop and utilize a skill set that reduces burnout. Three Ways Self-Service Enhances Agent Efficiency 1. By Reducing Call Volumes Self-service options, like automated chatbots and online knowledge bases, deflect routine queries by providing instant responses to common customer questions and issues to act as a first line of support. 2. By Increasing Resolution Speed for Complex Issues Agents can better understand the nuances of complex queries or escalate issues when necessary, and provide customized solutions that address the root of the problem rather than offering quick, superficial fixes. Customers receive more accurate, comprehensive, and personalized assistance. 3. By Improving Customer Preparation Customers who initially engage with self-service options tend to be better prepared when they eventually need to speak with a live agent, making these interactions more efficient. The preliminary self-service interaction acts as a bridge, ensuring that both customer and agent are on the same page from the outset of their direct communication. Navigating Challenges to Enhance Customer Experience with Self-Service Adopting self-service comes with challenges. Integrating self-service technologies into existing customer service ecosystems can be complex. They must offer a cohesive customer experience across all channels, which can be difficult given legacy systems and various software platforms. Additionally, maintaining the quality of self-help resources such as FAQs, knowledge bases, and chatbots is essential for these tools to be effective. This involves not only the initial creation of content but ongoing updates to ensure accuracy and relevance. But the effort pays real dividends when it comes to efficiency. The modern customer service landscape is making it clear that self-service options are crucial for meeting the contemporary consumer\u2019s expectations for speed, convenience, and autonomy. If your contact center tech toolbox has an empty spot where self-service should be? Consider how these technologies can fit into your current customer service strategy and the needs of your customer base. Take a closer look at software and solutions that align with your business goals and reach out for professional advice to kickstart your self-service revolution. After all, the more you help your customers help themselves, the more it helps you.

You\u2019re fully prepared to embrace innovation and champion digital transformation. But you don\u2019t know where to begin. That\u2019s why we suggest that you focus on your people. Your company trusts its field service engineers on the front lines. And every day you send them out to face challenges from customers and competitors. It\u2019s not easy out there. They need all the help you can give. The job is complex, requiring a wide range of skills and knowledge to properly install, maintain, and repair medical devices. But they deal with much more than just nuts and bolts and vacuum drift tubes and x-ray collimators. If you want your teams to over deliver on service expectations and help grow your business, you need to give them more than just a tool box and a truck. We\u2019ve compiled some tips and tactics for helping your service organization master the three C\u2019s of medical device field service: complexity, compliance, and communication. Conquer Complexity Keep pace with changing technology by making learning a habit, connecting with peers and leveraging your secret weapon If you grew up working on cars, you remember back when a simple set of socket wrenches was all you needed to get a conked-out ride back on the road. These days, what sits under the hood of cars looks more like a supercomputer. It\u2019s too advanced for most weekend mechanics, so they leave the sockets on the shelf and send their car to the experts. Your field engineers don\u2019t have that luxury. They have to be THE experts. \u201c75% of field technicians report that products have become more complex and more knowledge, specifically more technical knowledge, is needed to perform their jobs now vs. when they started in field service\u201d \u2013 The Service Council, 2021 Here\u2019s the challenge: Medical devices are already highly complex, with intricate mechanisms and systems that require specialized knowledge and expertise to understand. And that technology is advancing every day. Even more challenging? Medical device field engineers need a strong foundation in both the technical AND clinical aspects of devices. Not only do they need to understand how the devices function, but how they\u2019re used in the healthcare setting. That hulking MRI machine may look stationary, but every job callout for med device field engineers requires them to hit a moving target. Not only is the science behind those advanced machines constantly evolving, but the way hospitals and healthcare systems function is ever changing too. That\u2019s why education and training is never a \u201cone and done\u201d kind of deal. Service teams need to make learning a daily habit. Here are tips for keeping your team up to speed: Connect with a Community Industry conferences and trade shows are great opportunities to learn about the latest developments in the medical device industry and network with other professionals. If your sales and marketing teams regularly attend events, consider adding technical employees into the mix.Also encourage them to seek out med device resources online in the form of trade publications, video channels and podcasts. The internet is an all-you-can-eat buffet of relevant and increasingly niche information. Train for Tomorrow Why not give your service team a head start on what comes next? In addition to helping them master your current machines, look for opportunities to educate them on future medical technology.Med devices are evolving at a record pace thanks to advances in AI and machine learning, as well as nanomaterials and 3D printing. The future is no longer some imaginary place in the distance.BIG changes are coming in the next 5-10 years. Help them get ready. Leverage Internal Knowledge Every company has treasure troves of technical, industry and practical knowledge buried inside the heads of its people. Do yourself a favor and find ways to get it all out into the open. Protect yourself against \u201cGreat Resignations\u201d and the \u201cGray Tsunami\u201d by capturing the wisdom of your veteran technicians BEFORE they head out the door. You can immediately use that institutional knowledge to get new hires up to speed much faster. How? Create a system for interviewing and collecting information from your most experienced and valuable employees. Build a text or video library. Schedule your own \u201cAsk an Expert\u201d sessions. Or you could always tap into that valuable resource in real-time using a software platform that allows junior field techs who are on-site to connect remotely with experienced pros for real-time guidance. \u201cUsing remote support technology has improved on-the-job training and decreased the time to train new technicians by an average of 41%\u201d \u2013 SightCall Uncomplicate Compliance Cut down on penalties and fines by building systems, automating processes and making it harder to make expensive mistakes You already work on incredibly complex machines that save human lives. You are already asked to perform repairs under near impossible deadlines. Why not add a few layers of wildly complicated government guidelines and ever-changing federal and international regulations? Medical device service is nothing if not challenging. The machines you manufacture and service are subject to a range of regulations and guidelines, including those set by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and international standards organizations like the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). These rules vary by country, change frequently and stepping \u201cout of bounds\u201d can result in serious fines and penalties. The bottom line? Breaking the rules is bad for your bottom line. Here are a few suggestions for helping your field techs master the fine art of compliance: Set the Tone in TrainingGive your on-site engineers everything they need to know about compliance before they head into the field. Minimize costly errors by helping them understand the business impact of non-compliance. Design Systems for SuccessReduce careless tracking and documenting mistakes by setting up consistent systems. Implement policies and procedures for servicing medical devices correctly and in compliance with relevant regulations. Make sure you have a quality management system (QMS) in place to help ensure that medical devices are serviced to the highest standards of quality and safety. Automate to Reduce RiskTake a closer look at how service teams handle compliance information. Proper documentation and record-keeping practices are essential. This includes keeping accurate and up-to-date records of all service activities, as well as maintaining records on the performance and maintenance of medical devices.Does any of your compliance documentation process still include the use of pen and paper? Then you are exponentially increasing the risk of human error.One way you can lower that risk is with automated digital work instructions that eliminate the possibility of lost paperwork, sloppy handwriting or skipped forms. \u201cBusinesses lose an average of $11,000 per employee every year due to ineffective communications and collaboration\u201d \u2013 Mitel, 2017 Champion Communication Untangle crossed wires by creating clear channels that connect and empower your employees You rely on teams to solve problems and resolve issues. And teams require collaboration and coordination. But communication is the real glue that holds everything together. If you want to improve the efficiency of your service teams, here are some key communication questions to consider: How do you rate your \u201cpre-call clarity\u201d? Improving communication starts with the first service request. The better your team can set and manage expectations, the better. Understand exactly what\u2019s happening with the device on site before rolling a truck to ensure you arrive prepared. The more insight you get up front, the faster you can resolve the issue. You can use a number of different tools to improve clarity, but we\u2019re (understandably) partial to a visual platform that can capture media, scan data, and give you eyes on site. Are you optimizing the way that on-site employees communicate with other service team members and supervisors? If you\u2019re relying on smartphones and text messages, you need to make sure that vital information isn\u2019t falling through the cracks. When the messages include questions and details about real-time issues, what happens if one side doesn\u2019t respond? What if verbal instructions aren\u2019t clear or signal quality is poor? Setting up robust and reliable communication channels saves time. And the more information that can be exchanged through those channels, the better. Pictures are always better than words and video is best of all. If technicians get stumped on site, do they power through and hope for the best? Or are they empowered to reach out for guidance? Having a way to connect more than one employee in many different places helps amplify the effectiveness of your team. Instead of \u201cone tech, one truck,\u201d remote support tools give you the power to instantly deploy teams of experts when and where they are needed. Two heads are always better than one, even if one of those heads is virtual. Do you provide communication training in \u201cmedium skills\u201d? Odds are good that \u201cmedium skills\u201d isn\u2019t really a thing. But for now, let\u2019s pretend they fall between \u201csoft skills\u201d like communication, problem solving and teamwork and the much more technical \u201chard skills.\u201d \u201cMedium skills\u201d can be things like sales techniques, interviewing, and light detective work. Most field engineer employment ads already start with outlining requirements like \u201coutgoing, energetic and good with people.\u201d That\u2019s because field service engineers act as the face of your company on every single call. That\u2019s both a big responsibility and a huge opportunity. Don\u2019t miss the chance to make sure that every employee understands the value of face-to-face customer time. Get the job done right. Get the job done fast. But don\u2019t stop there.Encourage your field team members to be proactive and inquisitive. Great smiles go a long way, but the ability to collect actionable insights is even better. Yes, \u201ccollecting actionable insights\u201d sounds a bit nefarious, but the ultimate goal is to HELP your customer. Gaining insight helps you understand your customer\u2019s \u201cbig picture\u201d and recurring pains. Only then can you find new and better ways to delight them, anticipate their needs and make their business lives better. Transformation is a journey, not a destination Healthcare technology is in a constant state of change. Brilliant minds are stretching the boundaries of what\u2019s possible. And nobody knows for sure what the future holds for medical science. Chips are getting smaller. Computers are getting smarter. But people still matter more than ever. Focus on your people. There are no one-size-fits-all solutions for building a more efficient service organization. But if you\u2019re looking for growth, we humbly suggest that you invest in your greatest asset. Help them master the three C\u2019s, and give them the tools and technology they need to get better at what they do.

And in today\u2019s margin-tight environment, you can\u2019t afford that. And neither can your customers. As client expectations climb and skilled labor becomes harder to find, first time fix rate (FTFR) has become a defining metric in field service. But improving FTFR isn\u2019t just about sending better techs or buying better tools. It\u2019s about aligning service teams and tools Customers today expect Amazon-level service from every brand\u2014including yours. They don\u2019t care how complex the job is. They want it fixed. Fast. And right the first time. Your C-suite is just as demanding. You\u2019ve invested in artificial intelligence (AI), field service management (FSM) tools, and training programs. So why hasn\u2019t your FTFR moved? Maybe the problem isn\u2019t just more tactics, tech and tools\u2014it\u2019s better orchestration. Where Do You Stand Today? Before we dive in, here\u2019s a quick check to see where you stand among your peers. Of course, these numbers will vary by industry, but this will give you a sense of the ballpark. Better orchestration could help your techs fix 15\u201320% more jobs on the first visit\u2014without working harder. We think it\u2019s possible\u2026 and it all starts with a shift in how you manage those parts, people, processes, and proactive technology. The Right Part at the Right Time \u201cWithout the right part, even your best tech can\u2019t save the day.\u201d It\u2019s one of the oldest frustrations in field service: a technician shows up ready to work, but the fix can\u2019t happen because the right part isn\u2019t in the van. It\u2019s not a skills issue. It\u2019s not a customer issue. It\u2019s a parts issue. And it remains one of the most common causes of repeat visits, costing time, money, and customer trust. But here\u2019s the good news: this is also one of the most solvable problems\u2014especially today. A New Era of Parts Readiness Service parts management used to be reactive and manual. Technicians carried generic van stock, relying on best guesses or tribal knowledge to prepare for jobs. Inventory systems weren\u2019t connected to field operations, and procurement was often an afterthought. That model doesn\u2019t work anymore\u2014not with today\u2019s complex equipment and razor-thin service-level agreement (SLA) windows. Thanks to modern technology and smarter field service processes, we live in a time where predictive, data-driven parts readiness is possible\u2014and necessary. Here\u2019s how leading service teams are ensuring their techs show up fully equipped: AI-Driven Parts Prediction at Intake Modern systems use historical job data and machine learning to predict what parts are most likely needed for a specific issue. If a customer reports a recurring error code, your system can match that to past jobs, identify the required components, and recommend a parts kit\u2014automatically. This replaces guesswork with data. Instead of relying on what \u201cmight\u201d be needed, you\u2019re using patterns to predict what \u201cwill\u201d be needed. Real-Time Inventory Visibility for Dispatch Inventory systems are no longer siloed. Connected field service platforms allow dispatchers and planners to see (in real time) what\u2019s in each technician\u2019s vehicle, what\u2019s in the warehouse, and what\u2019s in transit. This helps ensure the right tech is sent with the right parts and can even trigger auto-replenishment for high-use items. Dispatchers can stop playing logistics detective\u2014they get instant clarity on availability. Pre-Dispatch Visual Inspections to Confirm Parts Before a tech ever rolls out, remote support tools allow your team to see the issue firsthand. A quick video call with the customer can verify what\u2019s broken and which part is needed\u2014especially useful in scenarios where symptoms can be misleading. A 5-minute visual check can prevent a costly return visit and wasted drive time. Standardized Part Kits for Common Jobs Build kits for the most common repairs and align them with technician roles and territories. These can be stocked based on seasonal patterns, geography, or equipment type. Smart automation ensures these kits stay replenished based on usage, not guesswork. Think of it like a pre-packed toolkit for success\u2014tailored by data. Diagnosing and Dispatching with Precision \u201cFirst-time fix starts long before your tech hits the road.\u201d Field service success starts the moment a service request comes in. And too often, the front-end of that process is broken. Historically, job intake has been unstructured. A customer calls in, describes a problem in layman\u2019s terms, and the service coordinator logs it in shorthand or a free-text field. \u201cUnit not working\u201d or \u201cmachine down\u201d becomes the job description. With that vague starting point, dispatch is flying blind. But that\u2019s changing. A Smarter Approach to Service Intake and Dispatch Modern service organizations are evolving from basic call logging to intelligent triage and dynamic dispatching, using data and automation to improve job accuracy\u2014and FTFR. Here\u2019s how: Structured Intake with Smart Forms Use guided intake forms instead of open-ended text boxes. These forms ask specific questions in a logical order, making it easier for customers to give the right information. With AI, the forms can adjust on the fly \u2014 asking follow-up questions based on what the customer says. This improves accuracy and ensures you get consistent, useful data for diagnosing issues and analyzing trends. A clear problem description means fewer surprises for the tech\u2014and higher odds of a fix on the first visit. Remote Visual Triage to Confirm Job Scope Before scheduling, use remote video support to confirm the issue. This adds clarity and helps triage whether the issue requires a field visit, can be resolved remotely, or needs specialized tools or parts. It\u2019s like doing a \u201cvirtual walkthrough\u201d of the job before committing boots on the ground. Integrated CRM + FSM Systems for Contextual Dispatch Modern platforms integrate customer records, asset history, and past service data. Dispatchers can make better decisions about which technician is best suited for the job based on skill, proximity, or equipment familiarity. The more context your scheduler has, the better they can match the right tech to the right job. Skill-Based Routing and Job Escalation Protocols Automatically match jobs to techs with the specific certifications, past experience, or OEM knowledge needed. Escalation workflows ensure complex jobs get flagged and assigned accordingly\u2014not left to a generalist unprepared for a niche issue. Precision dispatching reduces both service costs and resolution time\u2014while lifting FTFR. Watch a Video Demo of SightCall VISION for Field Service Equip Your Workforce for the Field \u201cEmpowered techs don\u2019t just fix more\u2014they fix smarter.\u201d It\u2019s no secret: there\u2019s a widening experience gap in field service. As veteran technicians retire, a wave of newer, less-experienced hires is stepping in. But the tools, machines, and software they face in the field have only gotten more complex. Traditionally, technicians learned on the job\u2014shadowing seniors, swapping war stories, and building muscle memory. That approach no longer scales. Today\u2019s service leaders need to institutionalize tribal knowledge and boost technician performance across the board. Here\u2019s how to create a team of consistent, capable fixers: Real-Time Expert Support via Video Don\u2019t let techs get stuck mid-job. Equip them with live video tools to call on remote experts in real time. Senior specialists can guide repairs \u2014no return visits needed. Your tenured techs become coaches-on-demand, extending their impact without ever leaving the office. Visual Repair Guides and AR-Enhanced Instructions Gone are the days of flipping through thick manuals. Field techs now rely on step-by-step visual instructions delivered via mobile apps or smart glasses. AR overlays show them exactly where to look, what to check, and how to proceed. This shrinks the learning curve and reduces the risk of trial-and-error. Just-in-Time Access to Service Intelligence Give techs mobile access to asset histories, previous work orders, service bulletins, and known issue resolutions. Contextual knowledge equals faster, smarter decisions. When a tech understands the full story, they troubleshoot with confidence and clarity. Performance Analytics and Coaching Programs Don\u2019t just measure FTFR\u2014analyze it by individual. Identify who consistently performs well and who struggles. Use that insight to deliver targeted coaching, training, or tool upgrades. Data-driven training ensures your weakest techs don\u2019t stay that way for long. Turning AI & AR into Field Force Multipliers \u201cTechnology should make every tech your best tech.\u201d The field service toolkit has evolved. Clipboards and pagers have given way to tablets, smart wearables, and real-time remote support. But it\u2019s not the tools themselves that matter\u2014it\u2019s how well they\u2019re connected and applied. Today\u2019s top-performing service orgs aren\u2019t just using technology\u2014they\u2019re orchestrating it. The goal isn\u2019t more tools. It\u2019s smarter, frictionless workflows that proactively prevent problems, streamline service, and raise every tech\u2019s performance. Here\u2019s how to turn your tech stack into a service multiplier: AR and Visual Assistance for Complex Repairs Use AR tools to guide technicians through repairs with real-time overlays, 3D diagrams, or animations. Whether they\u2019re in the field or a factory, techs get visual prompts layered onto the equipment. The repair process becomes interactive and intuitive, even for fresh hires. Seamless System Integrations Your CRM, FSM, knowledge base, and remote support tools should work in harmony. A disconnected tech stack leads to delays, data loss, and frustration. Ensure systems talk to each other so techs don\u2019t waste time toggling between apps. When systems are connected, your people stay focused on the fix\u2014not the friction. Predictive Maintenance Using IoT and AI The most powerful FTFR strategy? Prevent the failure before it happens. IoT sensors can track machine performance and trigger alerts when issues are brewing. AI then analyzes that data to recommend proactive service. It\u2019s not just fixing things faster\u2014it\u2019s reducing the need to fix them at all. Technician Dashboards and Job Prep Tools Equip every technician with a \u201cday-of\u201d dashboard showing job locations, expected issues, required parts, safety notes, and digital checklists. The more they know going in, the faster they work\u2014and the fewer return visits they\u2019ll need. It\u2019s like giving every tech a service concierge to prepare them for success. Ready to Build Your FTFR Game Plan? Improving first time fix rates doesn\u2019t happen overnight. But with the right structure\u2014Parts, Process, People, and Proactive Tech\u2014you can move the needle faster and with greater impact. Here\u2019s a quick self-check to start: Are your techs arriving with the right tools and parts? Is your intake process giving dispatch everything they need? Can your junior techs get expert help instantly? Are your systems and tools working with each other\u2014not against? Field service leaders who invest in these four pillars see the difference not just in service costs, but in happier customers, more confident technicians, and fewer return visits. FTFR Isn\u2019t Just a Number\u2014It\u2019s a Competitive Advantage Don\u2019t just troubleshoot\u2014solve. SightCall Vision gives you eyes in the field and insights in real time.

Video helps bridge distance, accelerate troubleshooting, and reduce costly truck rolls. But while apps like FaceTime, Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and WhatsApp offer a quick fix, they aren\u2019t built for the rigors of enterprise field service. It\u2019s time to recognize the difference between \u201cover-the-counter\u201d video chat software and purpose-built visual assistance solutions like SightCall \u2014 and the competitive edge they can deliver. Why Consumer Video Tools Are Costing You Time, Money, and Trust Let\u2019s get honest: tools like FaceTime and Teams are convenient \u2014 but they weren\u2019t designed for field environments, high-stakes diagnostics, or enterprise-grade workflows. Here\u2019s where they fall apart in the moment of service: No Integration with Service Workflows Consumer video apps weren\u2019t built for field service. They operate outside your enterprise systems, making it impossible to link calls to service cases, capture critical moments, or extract structured data. The result? Operational blind spots and more manual work for your teams. Example: A field engineer using WhatsApp to show a malfunctioning pump must then manually upload screenshots and notes into the FSM system \u2014 introducing delays, duplication, and errors. It also makes post-call reporting nearly impossible to automate. Lack of Diagnostic Tools Consumer video apps offer basic face-to-face interaction\u2014but they fall short when real troubleshooting begins. There\u2019s no way to visually annotate, recognize objects, or remotely point and guide technicians through a fix. Without those tools, true hands-on support isn\u2019t possible. Consequence: A tech may waste valuable time misidentifying a component or describing it inaccurately, leading to wrong part orders or second truck rolls. Over time, this compounds into lower first-time fix rates and higher service costs. Security and Compliance Gaps While Zoom or FaceTime may have encrypted options, they are not built to meet industry-specific regulatory requirements. When working in healthcare, finance, utilities, or aerospace, data security and compliance aren\u2019t negotiable \u2014 they\u2019re mission-critical. Risk: A single FaceTime call between a support agent and a medical equipment technician could expose confidential patient data \u2014 a compliance nightmare. Without audit trails or proper access controls, consumer apps simply don\u2019t meet enterprise standards. Inconsistent Performance in the Field Technicians often operate in remote, high-interference, or bandwidth-constrained environments. Consumer apps were built for Wi-Fi and suburban convenience, not for service bays, offshore rigs, or underground utility tunnels. Impact: A remote support call that drops mid-diagnosis or fails to load in a remote location costs time, money, and customer confidence. If your team can\u2019t rely on the tool, they won\u2019t use it \u2014 and you\u2019re back to expensive dispatches. How SightCall Solves the Problems That Consumer Apps Can\u2019t SightCall isn\u2019t just another video app. It\u2019s a remote visual support solution designed from the ground up for enterprise field service. Here\u2019s what sets it apart \u2014 and why that matters to you: Seamless Integration with Enterprise Systems SightCall integrates seamlessly with the platforms your service team already relies on\u2014like Salesforce, ServiceNow, and SAP. Every call is automatically tied to the right customer record, with media files, diagnostics, and technician notes saved exactly where they belong. Advantage: This eliminates redundant data entry, reduces errors, and empowers your support and field teams with contextual insights before and after the call. It also strengthens knowledge-sharing and team collaboration across the business. AI and AR-Powered Guidance With tools like AR overlays, remote flashlight control, barcode scanning, and AI-powered prompts, SightCall transforms a simple video call into a hands-on, expert-guided repair session. It\u2019s like having a senior technician right there, guiding every step\u2014no matter the distance. Competitive Edge: This shrinks the skills gap, accelerates training, and ensures consistent quality across the service team. Your best experts can now support more jobs in less time \u2014 without ever leaving the office. Built-In Security and Compliance SightCall is designed with enterprise-grade security baked in, not bolted on. It includes end-to-end encryption, secure media storage, role-based permissions, and detailed audit trails \u2014 all aligned with major compliance frameworks like HIPAA, GDPR, ISO 27001, and SOC 2. Peace of Mind: You don\u2019t have to second-guess whether a call is secure or if data will be mishandled. You gain the confidence to scale remote service safely in regulated environments. Built for the Field SightCall is optimized for the real-world conditions your techs face \u2014 low bandwidth, unstable connections, and remote geographies. It can adapt video quality on the fly, capture evidence even offline, and re-sync once the network returns. Resilience: When the stakes are high and the connection is poor, SightCall keeps the support going. This ensures that even the most remote sites are never truly unsupported. Watch a Video Demo of SightCall VISION Create a Competitive Advantage Your competitors are dealing with the same macro pressures: a retiring workforce, rising customer expectations, and operational budget scrutiny. What sets top-performing service organizations apart is how they enable their teams. A remote visual support solution helps you: Boost First-Time Fix Rates by empowering techs with instant expert support and visual guidance. Accelerate Ramp-Up for New Hires with structured workflows and real-time mentorship. Enhance CX and Loyalty by solving problems faster and reducing frustration for customers. Turn Service Data Into Strategy by capturing every session as a structured, searchable resource. Relying on consumer video tools for enterprise field service is inefficient, unsustainable and ultimately, irresponsible. You risk costly delays for customers, data loss, and missed opportunities for growth. These tools weren\u2019t designed for complex diagnostics, secure data handling, or seamless system integration. If you\u2019re still using Zoom or FaceTime in the field, now\u2019s the time to act. The longer you wait, the further you fall behind. Ready to stop settling for subpar support tools?

At the heart of the discussion? Knowledge capture: the art and science of preserving field expertise before it walks out the door. SightCall\u2019s Chief Operating Officer Ronan Souberbielle and Hans G\u00f6ttlinger, VP of Sales for DACH, UK and the Nordics, were there. We caught up with them for their takes on the topics and trends that were front and center. As Ronan put it:\u00a0\u201cThere\u2019s a huge sense of urgency on knowledge capture. Everyone was asking how technology\u2014especially AI\u2014can augment service delivery.\u201d The Knowledge Crisis Is Now The field service industry is on the edge of a generational cliff. While much has been said about the Silver Tsunami, the reality is broader: nearly 45% of field service engineers say they don\u2019t plan to stay in the profession long-term or aren\u2019t sure if they will. Even more concerning, only 28% of those planning to leave cite retirement as the reason. The other 72% are walking away due to burnout, unclear career paths, or disengagement. \u201cIt\u2019s five minutes to 12,\u201d Hans said. \u201cPeople are leaving every month. The retirement rates are already high. And I don\u2019t think there is one solution in place yet to capture all this knowledge in a structured way.\u201d Moving from Tribal to Transferable Knowledge Historically, field service expertise lived in the heads of veterans\u2014passed down informally through ride-alongs and word of mouth. But today, when 52% of a technician\u2019s time is consumed by paperwork and searching for information, there\u2019s no time to rely on tribal wisdom. In a world driven by speed, scale, and digital-first experiences, this model is no longer sustainable. Hans highlighted the problem: \u201cA lot of their knowledge is captured in people\u2019s heads rather than in digital platforms\u2026 Once these people retire, they take all the knowledge and it\u2019s gone.\u201d But even when organizations try to digitize knowledge, it\u2019s not always usable. Raw notes, PDFs, and videos need context, editing, and structure to be truly valuable in the field. \u201cYou can\u2019t just take the raw formats,\u201d Hans said. \u201cIt has to be redacted. And how do you get raw information from field service engineers? Probably by watching them work.\u201d This points to a future where knowledge capture is observational and interactive\u2014powered by smart video, AI, and automation. Observational Learning: The New Gold Standard One standout insight from the event was that real expertise isn\u2019t written\u2014it\u2019s demonstrated. The best knowledge often lives in technician muscle memory, gestures, and in-the-moment decision-making processes. \u201cService people are great at their job but terrible at writing things down,\u201d Hans said. \u201cYou won\u2019t get them to document knowledge that way. So we need to find other ways\u2014like observation and AI-based structuring.\u201d That means capturing live video and turning it into how-to guidance or training materials. \u201cThe best way to get knowledge might be by watching field service engineers work,\u201d Hans added. \u201cBut that\u2019s a big, big problem for organizations.\u201d Observational learning represents a shift away from traditional documentation and toward immersive, real-time capture. With the help of tools like augmented reality (AR), video support, and digital twins, organizations can now observe and codify technician actions in context. This approach not only captures what technicians know\u2014it reveals how they think. That kind of tacit knowledge is invaluable for onboarding new technicians and building intelligent support systems. But the infrastructure to support this must evolve. As Hans put it:\u00a0\u201cThere\u2019s no structured way to do this yet. That\u2019s the problem. And it\u2019s urgent.\u201d Watch a Video Demo of SightCall VISION AI and the Rise of Self-Service Knowledge Self-service expectations are rising fast\u2014especially among younger customers and employees. Hans noted that one panelist joked: \u201cMy generation fears three things: clowns, auditors, and people who call us.\u201d The takeaway? Gen Z expects to solve problems on their own\u2014without phone calls or escalations. But to deliver that, companies need a foundation of practical, actionable intelligence. Ronan explained: \u201cTo feed that kind of powerful self-service capability, you need knowledge. Today, that knowledge is not documented. That\u2019s why everyone is betting on AI to bridge the gap.\u201d This aligns with recent findings showing that\u00a0search-based self-service and computer-assisted troubleshooting are underutilized, yet key differentiators in customer experience. \u201cAI was the center of everything,\u201d said Ronan. \u201cThe ability to capture all that knowledge from field service teams and share it\u2014towards self-service activity or to train new joiners\u2014that\u2019s where they want to go.\u201d The drivers are clear. Customers want faster resolution and better self-service options. They\u2019re used to seamless digital experiences and expect the same when their equipment needs fixing. \u201cCustomers want things to be solved as soon as possible,\u201d Ronan added. Organizations that leverage AI to deliver this experience\u2014by converting technician insights into predictive guidance, smart troubleshooting, and training tools\u2014are setting the bar. Business Impact: Service as a Differentiator This isn\u2019t just about knowledge preservation\u2014it\u2019s a strategic move. With equipment downtime costing as much as $10,000 per hour in industries like manufacturing and medical devices, the ability to solve problems faster is a competitive advantage. Ronan said: \u201cService is now the key differentiator. It\u2019s very hard to differentiate on the product. But delivering exceptional service\u2014that\u2019s how companies stand out.\u201d Shifting left (moving support closer to the customer via self-service or remote support) doesn\u2019t just reduce cost\u2014it improves customer experience, speeds time to resolution, and supports sustainability goals by reducing travel. Make Knowledge Work Harder Field service leaders must treat knowledge like the strategic asset it is. Capturing it is no longer a nice-to-have\u2014it\u2019s business-critical. Whether through AI, video, or immersive tools, the focus must be on making expertise accessible, consumable, and impactful across every tier of the service organization. The future belongs to companies that: Capture real-world expertise\u2014automatically Leverage AI to structure and surface knowledge Empower customers and new technicians through intuitive, visual self-service Treat knowledge as a strategic asset, not a byproduct As Hans warned: \u201cIf you don\u2019t act now, you\u2019ll lose the knowledge\u2014and with it, the ability to compete.\u201d Don\u2019t Let Years of Wisdom Walk Out the Door Connect with us today to build a plan for capturing knowledge and reducing revenue loss Get a Demo Get Connected!

A wave of retirements among seasoned professionals, amplified by the high costs of onboarding new talent, the length of time required to bring new technicians up to speed, and the rapid pace of technological change, threatens to disrupt service delivery and hinder growth. For field service leaders, this is no longer just a workforce issue\u2014it\u2019s an emergency. Addressing it requires a bold approach: capturing institutional knowledge, investing in smarter training tools, and equipping teams with the technology to succeed in a transforming industry. The following data points highlight the scope and scale of the challenge. Some of them are more than a little shocking. But to keep the tone from slipping too deep into doom and gloom, you\u2019ll also find suggestions on how to take action and turn this looming crisis into opportunity. After all, as a field service leader, you know better than most that the smartest and fastest way to fix a problem is making sure you show up with the right tools. Silver Tsunami: The Impact of an Aging Workforce The aging Baby Boomer generation represents a significant challenge for field service organizations. Many companies are realizing that when their most experienced employees reach retirement, more are walking out the door and taking decades of accumulated knowledge and expertise with them. All of that insight will be lost forever unless proactive measures are taken. Accurate What it means for the future: Each retirement represents a loss of institutional knowledge\u2014proven methods, shortcuts, and customer relationship nuances that took decades to build. These are the men and women who have \u201cseen it all\u201d and became the go-to gurus for your junior technicians. Your best option is to catch them in the act while they\u2019re still on the job and in the field. What you can do now: Start a knowledge capture initiative, leveraging tools like video interviews, manuals, and digital repositories. Implement knowledge-sharing platforms to ensure insights are easily accessible across teams. Pair retiring employees with newer hires through informal mentorship programs to facilitate hands-on knowledge transfer. Field Service What it means for the future: Many organizations are underprepared for the wave of retirements looming ahead. Workforce planning needs to include strategies for succession and skill replacement. You need to start this yesterday. What you can do now: Design an accelerated onboarding program with digital tools, clear documentation, and mentorship to quickly bring new hires up to speed. Build programs that incentivize retirees to remain part-time mentors, consultants or remote experts. Collaborate with local trade schools or apprenticeship programs to build a pipeline of new talent. Aquant What it means for the future: The demographic shift underscores the urgency of addressing aging-related attrition. While older Americans are remaining in the workforce longer, the technology learning curve is steeper for many of them than it is for younger people. What you can do now: Design flexible positions for older employees to retain them longer. Provide options such as part-time work, consulting roles, or lighter workloads. Leverage technology that makes work less physically demanding for aging workers (ie remote support roles). Assign older technicians to high-stakes or complex cases where their depth of experience is invaluable. Maximize their impact on service outcomes. Onboarding & Upskilling: Bridging the Skills Gap With rapidly evolving technology and rising customer expectations, traditional training approaches no longer suffice. Organizations need to invest in smarter onboarding and continuous upskilling to empower their teams and remain competitive. Rand Corporation What it means for the future: The skills gap isn\u2019t just a staffing issue\u2014it directly affects customer satisfaction and service delivery. Inexperienced technicians who show up and find themselves stumped by a problem trigger delays and cost issues that compound quickly. Companies who accelerate their training just to get more bodies into the field often find that it\u2019s exponentially more expensive on the back end. What you can do now: Develop customized training programs that target specific skill deficiencies. Use augmented reality (AR) to provide real-time guidance and contextual learning. Schedule regular assessments to ensure skills stay relevant and up to date. 22 Century What it means for the future: High onboarding costs and long learning curves are unsustainable, particularly in high-turnover environments. While advances in technology such as AI and IoT may streamline some tasks, younger teams can still struggle with legacy equipment. The most effective training tool for new hires is still your most experienced employee. What you can do now: Reduce onboarding time with interactive tools like simulation-based training. Incorporate visual aids, video tutorials, and on-demand resources to accelerate learning. Create structured progress milestones to measure effectiveness and adjust training. World Economic Forum What it means for the future: Despite realizing its importance, most organizations lack robust strategies to train their teams effectively. The gap is only going to get wider in the years ahead. What you can do now: Build training partnerships with technology providers to ensure programs align with evolving industry needs. Develop career pathways that align training with growth opportunities. Make learning worth their time and effort. Leverage AI tools to identify and address specific skills gaps. Technology & Transformation: The Path to Modern Field Service Technology is reshaping the field service landscape, with remote tools and digital transformation creating opportunities to optimize operations. However, staying ahead requires balancing workforce development with technological adoption. TIME What it means for the future: Remote service is no longer a novelty; it\u2019s a key competitive advantage that enhances customer satisfaction and team efficiency. While not every call is a candidate for remote support, few tools are more effective for analyzing issues before rolling a truck. Visual remote support gives you the ability to triage issues before heading out to ensure that the right tools, parts and people arrive on site. What you can do now: Train technicians to use remote support tools effectively. Offer customers guided troubleshooting via visual support to reduce dispatches. Adopt AR-enhanced technology to help diagnose and resolve issues more efficiently. Spherical Insights What it means for the future: Growing demand for digital tools highlights the importance of adapting to industry changes to remain competitive. What you can do now: Conduct a quick audit of existing workflows, technologies, and customer pain points. Host a workshop or meeting to gather feedback from technicians about their biggest challenges and desired tools. Stay informed about industry trends to anticipate future workforce and technology needs. IDC What it means for the future: Digital transformation is no longer optional\u2014it\u2019s essential to keep pace with competitors. While it\u2019s easy for companies to feel overwhelmed by the enormity of the task, the first steps don\u2019t necessarily have to be giant leaps. After all, the best (and only) way to eat an elephant is one bite at a time. Instead of trying to move everything at once, start by replacing a single paper form with an online version and go from there. What you can do now: Start small by automating routine and repetitive tasks, then scale solutions over time. Launch a small-scale pilot of new technology with a select group of technicians or for a specific service line. Prioritize tools that integrate seamlessly with existing systems to minimize disruptions. Coordinate with IT, operations, and customer service teams to ensure alignment on digital tools and goals. Watch a Demo Video of SightCall Vision AI & AR: Transforming Field Service with Smarter Tools Artificial intelligence (AI) and augmented reality (AR) are no longer futuristic concepts\u2014they\u2019re here, reshaping the way field service teams work. These technologies empower technicians with real-time insights, predictive capabilities, and interactive training, enhancing efficiency and customer satisfaction while reducing operational costs. Zendesk What it means for the future: As workforce numbers ebb and flow, companies will look to artificial intelligence to pick up the slack and optimize where they can. AI tools have shown they have the potential to be more than just a stopgap. What you can do now: Equip technicians with AI-powered diagnostic tools to analyze equipment performance in real-time and suggest solutions to reduce downtime and improve first-time fix rates. Leverage predictive maintenance to identify and prevent equipment failures before they occur. Use AI to analyze technician performance data and provide insights into strengths, areas for improvement, and training opportunities. World Economic Forum What it means for the future: AI is not about replacing jobs\u2014it\u2019s about transforming them. The focus is shifting from repetitive tasks to strategic, high-value activities that require advanced skills. What you can do now: Focus on upskilling technicians to work alongside AI tools, turning them into higher-value problem solvers. Equip your team to handle advanced roles like data analysis and system integration. Emphasize human-AI collaboration, ensuring technology complements technician expertise. Deloitte What it means for the future: Humans are visual learners who retain information best by doing. Modern tools like VR and AR revolutionize how technicians get up to speed by making training immersive, interactive, and faster. What you can do now: Replace traditional classroom training with AR-powered, hands-on learning in the field. Implement VR modules for scenarios that are complex, dangerous, or costly to replicate. Use analytics to measure the effectiveness of training programs and refine them as needed. Knowledge Capture: Closing the Experience Gap In an industry where expertise is invaluable, effective knowledge management is crucial. Capturing and sharing institutional knowledge ensures that the next generation of technicians can operate at peak efficiency, bridging the gap left by retiring workers and helping new hires ramp up faster. True Context What it means for the future: Digital knowledge-sharing platforms ensure that critical information is preserved and accessible to all team members, regardless of location. Creating a digital resource is more cost-effective than traditional training methods and is easily scalable across different industries and geographies. What you can do now: Build a centralized knowledge repository with video tutorials, troubleshooting guides, and best practices. Encourage team collaboration through real-time knowledge-sharing tools. Regularly update the repository to keep information accurate and relevant. Service Power What it means for the future: Leaders recognize that knowledge is a competitive advantage, but many organizations struggle to manage it effectively. The generational shift of the service workforce has put the expertise issue front and center as companies look for better, more efficient ways to take what\u2019s inside the heads of their veteran techs and get it in the hands (and minds) of the rookies. What you can do now: Dedicate a focused period (e.g., one month) to aggressively capture and update knowledge, with specific goals and technician involvement. Create incentives for technicians to contribute by recognizing their contributions through rewards, badges, or performance metrics. Create and maintain customer-specific knowledge profiles, including equipment details, service history, and unique troubleshooting steps. Aquant What it means for the future: The knowledge and skills of top-performing employees set a benchmark for efficiency and quality. The most important job for you, as a field service leader, is figuring out how to close that gap and make everything they know available for those who need it most. What you can do now: Identify your top performers and document their processes for replication. Establish a standard process for documenting and submitting knowledge, such as using forms or mobile apps to capture information immediately after a service call. Use AI tools to analyze service records, video calls, and support tickets to automatically generate articles or suggested entries for the knowledge base. What\u2019s next for field service? When it comes to the future of the field service workforce, there are tough roads ahead. As a leader, you\u2019re probably used to all the scary numbers by now. Those ridiculously enormous facts and figures that seem insurmountable. But the talent crisis in field service isn\u2019t just about numbers\u2014it\u2019s about the people and knowledge that set your organization apart. The key to surviving and thriving in the face of such massive change? Hold tight to what you\u2019ve got and keep moving forward. As retirements accelerate and technology transforms the way we work, capturing and sharing your organization\u2019s unique collective knowledge, expertise, and information has never been more critical. Invest in knowledge capture processes, modern training methods, and transformative technologies, and you\u2019ll future-proof your workforce and maintain your competitive edge. Most importantly? Don\u2019t wait for the talent gap to get any wider\u2014act NOW to build a smarter, stronger, and more resilient field service team.

In every industry, the stakes are high for enterprises to deliver both accurate results and memorable experiences. A Microsoft study for Dynamics 365 found 58% of consumers would terminate a business relationship because of negative service interactions. In the pre-digital era, field service generally involved interim responses to immediate customer concerns. Increasingly, it is one of the many facets in a larger relationship that a customer has with an enterprise and its brand, cultivating meaningful connections for the former and generating a boost to the latter\u2019s bottom line from greater public loyalty. Those powering field work are also experiencing change. These roles are increasingly careers and investments rather than simply jobs. More engaged technicians, engineers and support workers serve more connected customers and create brand differentiation. Well before the pandemic, businesses turned to digital tools to adapt to necessary shifts in their service models. Recently, AI added new layers to their presence in customers\u2019 lives, supplying a key tool to respond to constantly evolving expectations and allowing for customers to be better understood. As the leader of a visual support platform that for more than a decade has supported companies\u2019 service and growth goals through digitization, I\u2019m perhaps a predictable evangelist of AI\u2019s transformative power. Still, from my experience, two takeaways demonstrate how AI can enable businesses to thrive and innovate within an ongoing field service revolution. Combined AI-Human Service Drives Stronger Issue Resolution \u2014 If Done Right Nearly all businesses strive to create satisfying customer interactions. Customers may not always realize, but they enter interactions wanting to be seen and understood, two nuances that create loyalty over time. Companies that use AI benefit from data that is fed into a larger engine of knowledge \u2014 analyzing events and detecting patterns \u2014 thus driving a more genuine understanding of customers and the problems they face. Armed with this insight, service providers can more quickly cut to the chase. Potential use cases are extensive. Field technicians, agents and knowledge workers are empowered by intuitive, trainable algorithms allowing them to immerse themselves in the customer experience. Interactions are backed by tools that track feedback received or offer live suggestions prompting the next steps in an interaction. The technology also has the potential to start a service session on its own, such as through a chatbot system, with a human agent only stepping in after a situation has been triaged first or only in complex cases. This isn\u2019t to say adoption of AI is an instant fix. Whether enterprises are purchasing a system or building one on their own, ensuring their business model is prepared to scale AI to take on challenges is essential for success. Even if a tool is brought on to augment person-to-person service, it would need to be knowledgeable enough about company operations to answer questions like, \u201cWhat is the status of my claim?\u201d or \u201cWhat\u2019s the estimated completion time for my repairs?\u201d Secondly, the preparedness of your AI partner and associated solutions will not make up for enterprises not having the proper data and research to back up their project. It is essential to get granular on desired key performance indicators and outcomes, asking which parts of the customer experience would benefit most from AI. This will vary from one company and industry to the next. In all cases, if this background work hasn\u2019t been done yet, now is the time to start. There is still a practical ceiling to AI\u2019s use. Most systems can handle answers to straightforward questions, rather than holding complex conversations. Lack of purpose and realism in adopting AI is like a car trip with no destination \u2014 not only going nowhere, but also depleting your fuel or battery. It\u2019s critical to consider these tools a valuable partner, but not a replacement. Watch a Video Demo of SightCall VISION Empowering Confident, Adaptable Field Teams With AI Cultivating the \u201cworkers of the future\u201d is a frequent AI goal. In my career, I\u2019ve had the chance to work with field service groups who used the technology to transform their culture from a skills-based \u201cdo what you were trained for\u201d organization to one where everyone can succeed. The impact on teams is fantastic, and the service delivered drastically improved. These groups grasped one lesson in particular that separated their experiences from the majority of enterprises for whom AI projects failed. The most important lesson \u2014 for both new users and those who stumbled post-implementation \u2014 was to critically evaluate how well their teams were trained to work with the technology. For example, Gartner suggests that, for 56% of companies, concern over staff skill with AI is a major impediment to effective adoption. Your company\u2019s goal should not be to work \u201calongside\u201d AI or for workers and technology to coexist in separate silos. The most successful adopters consider it to be another member of the team, one who does what humans don\u2019t want to, but one that must also be trained and molded to fit into daily operations and work toward overarching goals. Digital Transformation Remains Human-Centered Apprehension frequently precedes digital tool adoption. Businesses fear a lack of receptiveness by customers and teams fretting over a lost personal touch, concerned that only the young or tech-savvy will feel comfortable with a virtual service tool, or that resistance by teams will hinder their efforts. However, these benefits respond to an ongoing revolution in service by channeling technology\u2019s strengths into human goals. Wisely balanced AI-human solutions are the most innovative way to satisfy more exacting expectations for both customers and the workers who serve them, ensuring companies can remain at the cutting edge no matter how quickly shifts occur in their industries and around the world.

If Remote Assistance Makes Anyone Experts, What\u2019s The Future Of Maintenance? Thomas Cottereau CEO This article originally appeared in Field Technologies Online Whether for simple DIY or sophisticated technical projects, inside everyone is an expert waiting to be unleashed. This statement is sure to provoke skepticism in everyone from seasoned handymen to industry novices. One might scan the room they\u2019re in to assess whether they could fix miscellaneous items that broke or became faulty. A frozen clock on the wall, perhaps. A blinking television set, maybe. The mysterious failure of a customer\u2019s diagnostic equipment? Never. But in the same way user manuals can walk the average person through simple projects without fuss, the growth of remote visual assistance is destined to fulfill the same function, offering access to rapid fixes and real-time education with the touch of a button on a smartphone. Artificial intelligence (AI) and augmented reality (AR) are the keys opening this proverbial door. Depending on the level of integration remote support platforms have with a company\u2019s job management software, days and hours are condensed into minutes and moments in delivering rapid, intelligent, and customized advice or problem resolution. If scenarios like these are already a reality for numerous consumers and the experts who serve them, more widespread adoption invites a few questions: What does the future hold for field service? Just how far can technology go in bringing out a problem-solver even to someone new on the job? Perhaps most importantly, what benefits will be delivered for professionals who have dedicated their careers to maintaining the tools that enrich and sustain our lives? Introducing AI and AR AI and AR are two fundamental tools used to power remote assistance programs. Still futuristic in the public imagination, yet tried and tested by experts, companies have frequently tapped into them for myriad uses. IBM\u2019s deployment of AI in its human resources department, for example, made headlines last year with initiatives like a \u201cNetflix for employee development\u201d and training, with AI reportedly saving the company nearly a billion dollars overall. Evidence points to a much greater virtual presence in enterprise operations and, by extension, in daily life as service digitization expands. Just over a quarter of organizations in a large-scale 2021 survey said they operated revenue-generating AI projects, with another 35% indicating they had evaluated or tested such projects. Well before the COVID-19 pandemic, an IDC study shared the prediction of a year-on-year increase of 78.5% in spending on AR and virtual reality (VR) technologies between 2019 and 2020, reaching just under $19 billion. The company\u2019s projections for the global AI market were nearly a third of a trillion dollars by 2021, including spending on software, hardware, and services. But skepticism is still there, as is widespread misunderstanding and fear about perceived threats posed by the wider integration of AI and AR into daily life. The idea that these tools will replace, rather than augment, human work and creativity continues to be the most harmful. As such, adopters of these technologies need two things to achieve success. The first is a positive, transparent, and consistent message about how this technology will help ordinary people. The second, with supportive data behind them, should be clear goals and objectives in improving specific performance indicators. And few use cases are as real and meaningful as reimagining the customer experience. AI and AR for Superior Knowledge Transfer The use of AI and AR for remote repair and maintenance, helping and training customers and the technicians who serve them, arguably ticks both above boxes for a wide swath of companies. These technologies lend themselves well to training \u2013 being intuitive, adaptable, and easily incorporated into a range of operations and functions. AR-powered support often features tools that allow both customers and support workers to make drawings or marks on each other\u2019s screens, potentially eliminating confusing back-and-forth communication over identifying a small or obscure part or component. AI, either coupled with or independent of AR in a visual support tool, can store information from a visual support session, which is then fed into a database of digitized knowledge that can detect patterns and make recommendations accordingly. Faster and more responsive work can result in productivity improvements between 25% and 50% in completing complex tasks. AR has the potential to more than double learning outcomes compared to traditional training environments. Companies with minimal time to train a new worker or an existing technician on a complicated skill can potentially place them on a job site and provide immersive learning in real-time, with a remote expert guiding them through a task or through wearables like headsets that can provide instructional overlay. To return to the example of diagnostic equipment, imagine that a field technician arrives at a job site to find it malfunctioning due to a small, broken part they have trouble identifying on their own. Remote support can bypass the traditional, time-consuming route of calling or requesting someone more senior. With a few taps inside an app on the technician\u2019s smartphone, they are connected to an off-site expert who can not only walk them through the identification of the part but also order a new one for delivery then and there. Removing several steps in the process frees up everyone to deal with more meaningful tasks \u2013 customers included. Productivity increases when a technician can accommodate more appointments in their day. And customer satisfaction improves when the expectation of a lengthy, complicated process is met instead by a succinct fix that puts their appliance back together and returns them to their day. How Will Field Service Be Further Transformed? Customer relationship expert Steven van Belleghem\u2019s research found that 40% of people prefer self-service to human contact. The concept of AR- and AI-powered interfaces guiding them through simple fixes on their own with minimal or no technical involvement already exists in the field. But given the sheer potential of these technologies, it\u2019s worth asking just how central this will be to future service models. How much will customers want to fix on their own, particularly without companies facing a potential backlash for the perception that responsibilities and duties are being passed off? Do the limits of AR and AI technology determine what fixes are too complicated for people to perform themselves, or is this determination made another way? These may remain open questions for some time. But currently crystal clear is that making knowledge long considered the purview of experts more accessible to everyone is a matter of quality of life \u2013 and an increase to your bottom line. When simple problems come with simple resolutions, and answers are more quickly at people\u2019s fingertips, they can spend more time thinking, creating, and doing what matters most. The world, in turn, becomes a better place.

The world\u2019s population aged 60+ is growing faster than any other age group. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), by 2022 more than 25% of the U.S. labor force will be in the 55+ age category. In a recent report by The Service Council, workforce and talent issues were highlighted as one of the top challenges faced by service organizations with 70% of field service organizations reporting they are concerned about knowledge loss related to the retiring workforce and insufficient incoming workers. Many service organizations are seeing the benefits of remote virtual support to solve two related problems at once: capturing the knowledge of experienced technicians while attracting and training new talent. Knowledge Sharing through Experience Learning studies have shown that workers prefer learning from each other over more formal training methods. Mentorship and coaching programs combat future knowledge loss while fostering camaraderie within the workforce. These programs also help incoming workers identify career paths and specializations that they might want to pursue, which reduces churn. By pairing the benefits of mentorship with the power of technology, field service organizations are finding that using remote support they solve two problems at once. First, they allow technicians approaching retirement age to stay in the workforce for longer by supplying their experience, knowledge, and insight remotely. Second, they are able to onboard new talent quickly. Having remote expert technicians ready to assist means getting new workers in the field faster while providing them all the resources they need to successfully perform services while expanding their knowledge. Leveraging Technology to Empower Technicians Specific recommendations on what technology is helping reduce the skills gap in field service included using mobile devices to reduce administrative tasks and remove obstacles from technicians\u2019 workdays. Remote visual support does both by streamlining processes without cumbersome manual data entry and providing rich resources and access to experienced experts. One of the other highlighted recommendations was increasing the level of connectivity to increase efficiency. Specifically, eliminating unnecessary truck rolls through remote visual assistance that improves diagnostic procedures and information access. Harnessing the Power of AR Using Augmented Reality technology is a popular strategy to address the issue of the aging workforce as well as a way to increase first-time fix rates and improve efficiency by reducing truck rolls. Most organizations using or evaluating augmented reality see clear value in using the technology in both field service execution and field service performance support. AR has extensive implications for training delivery including dynamic content creation. The benefits of this are multifold: as technicians are better prepared for their tasks with the help of augmented content and access to remote experts, they are able to resolve service tasks with the most efficient use of both parts and time. Success with SightCall At SightCall, we\u2019re helping field service organizations to overcome this challenge through the power of remote visual assistance. Our customers have been able to bridge the knowledge and skills gap between older generation field technicians and new trainees and apprentices.

The definition of a truck roll is any situation where a technician is dispatched, in a truck or other vehicle, to solve a problem. Truck rolls are a necessary part of many customer and field service operations. Common reasons for truck rolls are to install or repair equipment, do regular maintenance and inspections, or perform any other form of technical service. There are several ways to reduce truck rolls that improve efficiency and reduce costs for any kind of service enterprise. Truly understanding the problem and having guided self-service options can eliminate unnecessary truck rolls. Ensuring that the right technician is dispatched with the right tools and knowledge can reduce the need for multiple visits to resolve a single problem. Likewise, with the right tools and support, technicians can perform tasks more quickly, saving time and money with each visit. Visual assistance and AR technology solves all of these problems simultaneously, ensuring that technicians are only dispatched when needed, with everything they need to quickly complete tasks the first time. Watch a Demo Video of SightCall VISION for Field Service What is the real cost of a truck roll? To understand the potential savings of reducing truck rolls, it is important to look at the complete cost of a truck roll in your organization. If your company has an idea of the cost per dispatch, it\u2019s likely to be underestimating the true cost. Many organizations estimate individual truck roll costs between $150-$500 each. The true number, including all the indirect costs, is likely to be over $1000. The true cost of a truck roll includes: Labor costs \u2013 technician wages, travel time, administration tasks related to dispatch Vehicle costs \u2013 fuel, maintenance, insurance, depreciation of vehicles Opportunity costs \u2013 a technicians time spent on one task means being unavailable for any other billable work When you add all these costs together and multiply them by the number of truck rolls you can see the true cost of truck rolls and the amount you can save by implementing the right tools. Visual Support Can Reduce Truck Rolls Augmented Reality powered visual assistance enables companies to use remote support to visually guide customers and field technicians to resolve problems remotely. By combining live video with augmented reality features, a remote expert can guide anyone onsite to troubleshoot and perform needed tasks without a truck roll. In situations where a technician is truly needed, the remote visual support session establishes the specific problem, determines the needs for the task, and sends the right person with the right knowledge and equipment to ensure a first-time fix. Remote Visual Support: Eliminates unnecessary truck rolls Increases first-time fix rates Allows technicians to solve more problems with less travel Increases Customer and Technician Satisfaction Shortens technician training time by offering them instant expert support in the field Truck Roll Optimization: Common Problems and How to Solve Them A High Number of No Fault Found (NFF) Dispatches These are situations where the problem can be solved quickly, often in less than five minutes. With visual support, NFF dispatches can be almost entirely eliminated, by offering a visual support session before ever sending a technician out. Number of NFF Dispatches per month x Cost per Truck Rolls = $ That Could be Saved with Remote Visual Support Low First-Time Fix Rate According to one estimate, 25% of all service calls require at least one additional visit to solve a problem. The most common causes of multiple visits are: an unqualified technician was dispatched, the lack of correct tools or parts, problems related to accessing the service area. By beginning each service request with a visual support session, problems that will require a technician are seen clearly, enabling agents to send the right person and tools the first time. With HD photos and video saved right into the CRM or FSM file, everything related to the task is readily available for the technician before they leave. Negative Customer and Technician Experience With long wait times, and multiple visits often required, customers are often frustrated with the experience of a truck roll. Likewise, technicians report that they are happier when they can solve problems right away without unnecessary or repeat visits. Visual support offers a way for customers to contact an agent who can triage and troubleshoot issues right away, by using any smartphone, tablet, or computer to show them what they see. When the issue can\u2019t be solved remotely, they can be assured that the right person will arrive with everything they need to reach a resolution in a timely manner. Technicians who are dispatched after a visual support session have access to photos, videos, and notes that show them exactly what needs to be done and where. If they encounter a problem that requires more expertise, they can use the same visual support tool to consult with senior technicians or subject matter experts while on site. According to a 2023 Aquant benchmark report, a failed first visit leads to an average of 2.75 total visits to resolve the service issue, as well as adding approximately 13 days to your Mean Time to Resolution. Increasing Complexity of Products With the rise of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices are becoming more complex, and the number of truck rolls to service and support them is increasing. Customer expectations for professional help to install, maintain, and service smart equipment is going up. Technicians likewise listed the increasing complexity of equipment as one of the top challenges they face in the field. Providing remote support options gives service organizations a way to leverage their experts more efficiently, by having them help customers or technicians on-site through live video. Instead of spending all their time on travel, subject matter experts can provide support either directly to customers or to junior technicians who can then learn and train in the field providing top-notch customer experiences. Benefits of Visual Support Reducing truck rolls with AR-powered visual support offers cost savings across the board while providing a better customer experience. Allowing technicians and agents to see the problem with their own eyes eliminates communication problems without having to depend on customers or technicians to accurately describe the problem. SightCall maximizes technician potential.

They\u2019re struggling to describe what\u2019s happening while your agent tries to diagnose the problem blindfolded\u2014relying on guesswork and a script. The clock ticks, the customer\u2019s patience wears thin, and what could\u2019ve been a quick fix turns into a lost opportunity. Sound familiar? For today\u2019s contact center leaders, this isn\u2019t just a one-off scenario\u2014it\u2019s a daily challenge. Customers demand lightning-fast solutions and seamless experiences, while your team juggles escalating workloads and rising expectations. The big question: how do you consistently deliver exceptional service without stretching your team or your budget to the breaking point? Here\u2019s the answer: visual support tools. By empowering agents to \u201csee\u201d the issue in real time, these tools cut through the guesswork, turning frustrating exchanges into efficient problem-solving. The result is faster resolutions, happier customers, and measurable ROI that puts your contact center ahead of the curve. Let\u2019s look at five ways visual support is reshaping customer service\u2014and why it may be the CX solution your team has been waiting for. 1. Solve Problems Faster: The Key to First-Call Resolution (FCR) Why It Matters: First-call resolution (FCR) is the service world\u2019s holy grail. When customers call for help, they expect quick answers and effective solutions. In fact, 82% of customers prioritize speed in their support interactions, according to Zendesk. Visual tools give agents the context they need to deliver exactly that. Think of them as the difference between guessing the answer to a puzzle and having the solution key. How It Works: A customer reports their washing machine isn\u2019t draining. Traditional Support: The agent asks a series of clarifying questions, relying on verbal descriptions. Misunderstandings stretch the call to 15 minutes, but the issue remains unresolved. Visual Support: The agent sends a video session link. The customer shows the error code, and the agent uses augmented reality (AR) to guide them to clear the clogged filter in 10 minutes. Impact on ROI: Companies using video tools report a 30% improvement in FCR. ( Animoto ) Resolving issues on the first call reduces escalations, lowers costs, and strengthens customer trust.

Dispatching a field agent can cost $200-$300 per trip, and that\u2019s not counting the environmental impact of unnecessary travel. Visual tools allow agents to handle these problems remotely, turning costly in-person repairs into manageable virtual fixes. How It Works: An HVAC system shows an error code, and the customer can\u2019t figure out what\u2019s wrong. Traditional Support: After 30 minutes of troubleshooting over the phone, the issue is still unclear. A technician is dispatched, costing $250 and taking two days to arrive. Visual Support: The agent uses a live video session to diagnose a loose wire and guides the customer to fix it within 15 minutes\u2014no technician required. Impact on ROI: Remote support is helping companies cut on-site visits by 50%, delivering significant cost savings. (SightCall) One consumer goods firm reported a 15% drop in average service costs and 10% reduction in parts wastage after adopting visual diagnostics. (SightCall) 3. Win Hearts (and Loyalty) with Seamless Customer Experiences Why It Matters: Customer loyalty depends on experience. 80% of customers say their experience with a company is as important as its products, according to Salesforce. Visual tools help you provide faster, more personalized service, which leaves customers feeling valued and supported. How It Works: A customer struggles to connect their new smart TV to Wi-Fi. Traditional Support: After 30 minutes of vague instructions, the customer gives up, frustrated and dissatisfied. Visual Support: The agent sees the customer\u2019s issue in real-time, uses AR to highlight the correct network, and resolves the problem in 10 minutes. Impact on ROI: Video platforms have driven 25%-30% increases in CSAT scores, with customers appreciating the speed and clarity of visual support. (Gartner) Seamless interactions increase the likelihood of repeat purchases by 82%. (Gartner) 4. Empower Your Agents and Reduce Turnover Why It Matters: Agents are the backbone of any customer support operation, and their performance is directly influenced by the tools they use. When agents are overwhelmed with repetitive tasks or unclear problems, job satisfaction plummets. Visual tools flip the script by simplifying workflows and making troubleshooting faster and more intuitive. This allows agents to focus on meaningful, engaging work. How It Works: A new agent supports a customer whose router won\u2019t connect. Traditional Support: The agent spends 30 minutes asking questions and guessing at solutions, leaving both parties stressed and frustrated. Visual Support: The agent sees the problem instantly, identifies the unplugged Ethernet cable, and resolves the issue in 10 minutes using AR guidance. Impact on ROI: Visual tools can reduce average handle time (AHT), allowing agents to handle more cases. Video support increases empathy and can lower customer frustration when trying to solve a problem. 5. Get a Head Start with Pre-Call AI and Automation Why It Matters: Preparation is half the battle. Pre-call automation powered by Visual AI gathers vital information before the agent even picks up the phone. Photos, videos, and automated diagnostics streamline the process, allowing agents to focus on solving\u2014not diagnosing\u2014problems. This proactive approach saves time and creates a smoother customer journey. How It Works: A customer calls about a dishwasher that isn\u2019t draining. Traditional Support: The agent spends the first 10 minutes gathering basic information like the model number and symptoms. Troubleshooting takes another 20 minutes, but the problem remains unresolved. Pre-Call AI: The customer scans the dishwasher serial number and uploads a photo and video of the issue before the call. AI identifies the likely cause (a clogged pipe), and the agent resolves the issue in 10 minutes with targeted guidance. Impact on ROI: Pre-call automation reduces handle time and allows agents to get right to the customer\u2019s issue. One large-scale contact center saved 4,000+ agent hours weekly by automating pre-call tasks. Visual Remote Support ROI: Beyond the Numbers Visual support tools are not just another enhancement\u2014they\u2019re a way to reshape customer service. By enabling faster, more seamless problem-solving, they elevate customer experiences, strengthen loyalty, and empower your team. As expectations for speed and personalization grow, these tools ensure you\u2019re not just keeping up but leading the way. With CCaaS platforms integrating AI-powered insights and omnichannel experiences, visual technology has become essential. Investing in these tools now positions your contact center at the forefront of this transformation, equipping you to meet rising demands and outpace competitors. But don\u2019t just take our word for it\u2014see the impact for yourself.

If this is you, you better take some time to read the rules before coding. For healthcare, rules are defined by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). HIPAA regulates how patients\u2019 information must be handled by healthcare professionals (covered entities) and their partners (business associates). As an example, the covered entity could be a health insurance company while the business associate could be a startup that utilizes Protected Health Information (PHI) for its mHealth app. Developers Hate HIPAA The rules defined in HIPAA may be subject to many interpretations, making them challenging to translate into technical specifications. Although the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services clarified HIPAA with the publication of the Omnibus Rule last year, developers are still left with unanswered questions. Last September, ACT | The App Association called on Congress to adopt a more sensible implementation of HIPAA: HIPAA compliant data storage is a hot topic for every mHealth startup handling PHI. Companies like TrueVault or Catalyze have already published good resources on the subject so I won\u2019t expand on this point. In this article, I\u2019ll answer the main question asked by developers building video-powered healthcare apps for telepsychiatry, teledermatology or online doctor consultation services, or teleconsultation. At SightCall, we talk with many developers who ask for advice regarding the use of video calling for their medical app. The most asked question is: \u201cHow can I add HIPAA compliant video conferencing to my app?\u201d. If this is a question you have, read on to reach the light at the end of the tunnel. Understanding HIPAA Compliance for Video Consultations HIPAA is broken into several sections, the two main ones being the Privacy Rule and the Security Rule. While the former applies to PHI in all forms (paper, oral, electronic, etc.), the latter applies only to PHI in electronic form (E-PHI). The Security Rule is the section that is most closely scrutinized by developers, as it sets security standards to protect any E-PHI created, received, maintained or transmitted by covered entities and business associates. Technical specifications such as authentication, unique user identification or encryption are discussed in the Security Rule. When it comes to video conferencing, the Security Rule has a straightforward answer: Indeed, the Security Rule applies to electronic media, which as defined in HIPAA means (1) electronic storage media; or (2) transmission media used to exchange information already in electronic storage media. In other words, as long as your app does not record the consultation between the doctor and its patients, the video chat capability does not add additional requirements to meet in regards to the Security Rule. Concerning the Privacy Rule that controls when and how PHI can be disclosed, it really boils down to one question: \u201cwho is dealing with PHI?\u201d If your app does not create, receive, maintain or transmit PHI, there is no need to worry about HIPAA in the first place. In the opposite scenario, PHI may be shared with a third party, as telehealth apps often rely on a partner to power the video calling feature. If this happens, the third party (\u201csubcontractor\u201d in HIPAA terminology) becomes a business associate as well. As a consequence, you must obtain satisfactory assurances that your video calling API provider meets the requirements of the Privacy Rule. These assurances include a wide range of measures such as privacy policies, workforce training program, and data safeguards. Clearly, assessing these measures isn\u2019t something startups want to spend their time on when choosing a provider. The best way to reduce the burden of complying with the Privacy Rule is to choose a video conferencing service that does not require access to PHI. You may be wondering which patient health information is PHI and which information is not. The answer is simple: patient health information is considered PHI only if it can be linked to an individual who can be identified. Taking the example of an online doctor visit app, you\u2019ll want to make sure that both the doctor and the patient participating in the call have their authenticity verified based on their user ID. This means you\u2019ll need to choose a video conferencing service that comes with an authentication mechanism calling user IDs from your app. You may want to use emails for user IDs; however, this means you\u2019ll be sharing PHI with a subcontractor as emails allows tracing back to individuals\u2019 identities. So, how can you anonymously authenticate users to the video call? The answer is to use opaque user IDs. Opaque IDs can be strings of random characters that are defined in your app and tied to a unique user. Your video chat API provider will use them to anonymously authenticate your users to its video cloud service. Bottom line: you don\u2019t need to worry whether your subcontractor stores user IDs in a HIPAA compliant manner. Making sure you are not sharing PHI with your video provider is really the most important point to consider, as it avoids extending the applicability of HIPAA to another party. That said, remember that all the above applies to a scenario where conversations are not stored. If you\u2019re looking to add video recording, you\u2019ll need to implement additional safeguards as defined in the Security Rule. The same is true if screen sharing and file transfer (often complementary to video conferencing) is used to share PHI. Also, keep in mind that security measures required to be HIPAA compliant may not be sufficient to reach the level of privacy you aim for your app. For instance, I highly recommend considering end-to-end encryption of the media in transit even though it goes beyond requirements defined in the Privacy and Security Rule. This safeguard will prevent discussions between patients and doctors to be snooped on. Hopefully this article has clarified your understanding of how HIPAA applies to video conferencing so you don\u2019t pass on the opportunity to build the next $1 billion app! Indeed, the global telehealth market is estimated to reach $4.5 billion in 2018, growing tenfold from 2013. At the same time, six of ten doctors and patients claim not to be hesitant about using digital health technology. These numbers outline a steady base of users willing to adopt telemedicine!

From the earliest days of drums and horns to firelight and smoke signals, communication has evolved to benefit us. From those drums to telegraphs, to the internet communication is rapidly changing how we interact with those around us. Today, cousins can connect in a matter of seconds with a video call directly on a phone, without even being connected by annoying wires. Much in the same way you use technology for personal matters, your doctor is looking at using the technology to improve your health. While telemedicine has become a buzzword lately, you might be surprised to learn that telemedicine has been around since early in the 20th Century. The Birth of an Idea Some point to the early days of radio as the start of telemedicine, as people started to imagine a day when the doctor would visit you through your radio. The NCIB points to a 1924 Radio News magazine cover that not only shows a radio in a home but also depicts a video screen with a doctor talking to the family. Of course, this was only a vision of what was possible, but it was the beginning of the thinking behind telemedicine. If the editor could only see what telemedicine can offer today. Early Telemedicine It wasn\u2019t until the 1950s that telemedicine started to mold itself into an early version of what is offered today. In 1948 the first radiologic images were sent via telephone across 24 miles in Eastern Pennsylvania. Building on the technology, a Canadian doctor built a teleradiology system to transmit images in and around Montreal in the 1950s. By the end of the decade, clinicians at the University of Nebraska were the first to use video communication for medical purposes. They used two-way interactive televisions to send information across campus. Most of these early use cases were built due to concern over reaching rural patients but by the late 1960s urban centers were rapidly adopting the technology and adjusting it to fit their own specific needs. In Miami, for example, the fire department and the university medical center worked together to transmit electrocardiographic rhythms over voice radio channels from fire rescues. It is still common practice to send cardiac rhythms during emergencies, although the technology has greatly improved. The Growth of the Telemedicine Industry With so many use cases in place, the U.S. Government started to recognize the positive impact telemedicine was having on healthcare in the country. Not only was it helping remote patients, but the biggest impact was the communication of vital information in critical times with very little delay. The Department of Health and Human Services, NASA, Public Health Service, and Department of Defense were all supportive of new technology and some were actively involved in furthering research into the field. One of these telemedicine projects\u00a0was a joint partnership between NASA, the Indian Health Service, and what is now the Department of Health and Human Services called STARPAHC, or Space Technology Applied to Rural Papago Advanced Health Care. The goal was to provide healthcare to a remote tribe of Native Americans on the Papago Reservation in Arizona. The Papago tribe was very isolated so by providing many medical devices, including an electrocardiograph and x-ray machine which transmitted information back to specialists at the Public Health Service Hospital. The communication was sent by two-way microwave transmissions. From projects like this, both government and private sectors developed and supported research to help the growth of telemedicine. Over the following decades, advances continued to come from everywhere as universities, medical centers, private industries, and many others realized what wonders could be done with telemedicine. Modern Telemedicine Many of the same early devices are still used today, with only technological advances making them stronger and faster than their early counterparts. Naturally, one of the biggest advantages of telemedicine is the reduction of costs for providers and patients alike. Equipment prices have drastically decreased as research has expanded. Teleradiology machines are commonplace in hospitals. Cardiac rhythms are sent from emergency missions back to health centers thousands of times every day. Doctors are using telemedicine to monitor vitals after surgery when they cannot be physically present or it was performed off-site in a place such as a nursing home. Already across the country providers are giving telepresence as an option to reduce unnecessary or excessive travel. A simple video call can replace face-to-face interaction with your doctor for things such as telepsychiatry or routine check-ins with a doctor. The rise of wearables is already increasing interest in telehealth. Companies are using wristbands, heart rate monitors, and computer chips implanted in shoes to track a wide range of information about a person\u2019s health and exercise. Smartphones have made that information accessible. Soon doctors will use that information to track a patient\u2019s well-being. Now with smartwatches and smart glasses, communication is a voice command or blink of an eye away. The possibilities are virtually endless as doctors, private research firms, and the government continues to discover new types of telemedicine and better use cases to improve healthcare. The industry is only getting started. You don\u2019t need to travel far. Your doctor doesn\u2019t need to travel far either. How far we\u2019ve all come. Where do you see telemedicine going in the future as the industry continues to evolve?

This lead to extreme brand loyalty, repeat purchases and other unmeasurable value for the company. Nowadays, most brands turn to social media and other forms of \u201csocial\u201d marketing to create such customer engagement as a substitute for never having an actual human interaction with a customer. Knowing that human beings need relationships in both their personal lives as well as when they\u2019re buying things leads to the endless struggle for companies to build relationships with their customers, form strong user engagement and ultimately drive better sales. Although some brands market to and engage their customers online extremely well, not every company has been so lucky. So how do we stand out over our competitors when trying to engage our customers? There are a few ways small businesses can drive better sales by building stronger customer relationships online. 1. Survey Your Customers and Get Their Opinions Giving your customer exactly what they want is probably the best way to make sales, build trust and gain repeat customers. It\u2019s pretty much the ideal situation for any business. Creating customer personas is building strategy 101 but how granular can we get with our customer that way? How exactly do you figure out what your customers\u2019 needs and wants are? The answer is simple. Send them surveys. Before marketers ventured online, market research was conducted by old fashion questionnaires. The whole, \u201cHow much do you agree with this statement?\u201d question \u2013 I always picked \u201cStrongly Disagree\u201d kind of like how I always chose \u201cC\u201d on multiple choice tests. Regardless of those standard of error metrics that bore most normal people, we can get real good insight from our customers by surveying them. Customer surveys and feedback can be done through email, on the website or through social media channels. SurveyMonkey is one of the survey platforms available that allows you to send targeted surveys to customers through different platforms such as email and social media networks. Qualoroo is another way to get valuable insight from your customers right when they land on your site. 2. Communication Through Email Building an email list is probably one of the most important ways a company can stay in contact with their customers, build rapport and make sales \u2013 unless you come across as a spammer. If every email that you send out is salesy then you\u2019re doing it wrong. Emails should be able to provide valuable content for the consumer to share. When you provide content that addresses the need and provides a solution to your customer\u2019s problem then you build rapport and foster the digital relationship that you company needs to be successful. 3. Real-Time Video Chat for Customer Support Real-time video chat is a real hot topic with companies that are looking to build better connections with their online users. Late last year, Amazon introduced their \u201cMayday Button.\u201d This new feature on the Kindle Fire allowed a user to receive a video connection with a customer support representative. Never before has an online consumer been able to communicate with a company in such an innovative way and at such a scale. Today, Amazon boasts that a user can live video chat with a customer support representative in under ten seconds. That sure beats waiting on the phone and listening to such wretched music while on hold. It\u2019s obvious that the way we do business has changed and one of the funniest and most common phrases in business today is, \u201cIt\u2019s nice to finally put a face to that voice.\u201d The accuracy of that phrase is astonishing because it actually is quite nice to put a face to that voice especially since meeting someone in person allows you to more easily build rapport and form a better working relationship. As a company that does most, if not all, of their business online this isn\u2019t the easiest thing to do. Real-time video chat, or video calling, is the closest way that we can create a \u201cphysical\u201d connection online with our customer and it is reported that 75% of all customer contact from the Amazon Fire HDX now come via the Mayday Button. As you can see, adoption of such a technology is evident. 4. Rewarding Your Best Customers It is human nature to want to be liked so acknowledging your most loyal customers is a great way to continue to strengthen your relationship \u2013 do it in front of others and it works exponentially. We all know the 80/20 rule where 20% of your customers make up 80% of your sales so here are so more accurate statistics about how important your most loyal customers are from Entrepreneur.com, \u201cAccording to global management consulting firm Bain and Co., a 5 percent increase in retention yields profit increases of 25 to 100 percent. And on average, repeat customers spend 67 percent more than new customers. There are many ways to reward your customers through social media. Whether you\u2019re using gamification, running contests and giving away free prizes or simply saying thanks there are many ways to show your loyal customers that you care. Read here for more ways to engage your loyal customers via social media. As our society turns to more digital communication and commerce, building strong relationships with your customers isn\u2019t easy. Amazon\u2019s CEO, Jeff Bezos, said \u201cAll businesses need to be young forever. If your customer base ages with you, you\u2019re Woolworth\u2019s.\u201d The meaning behind that message is to stay adaptive to your business environment and to the ever-changing business landscape. We need to understand that doing business online is the new norm and building quality relationships with your customers online is not only a great business idea, it\u2019s a necessary one.

Here\u2019s a high-level overview of the benefits across the healthcare ecosystem that can be derived from Telehealth to help everyone understand the benefits the technology affords. Patient Benefits Being a father of a child with a disability I can tell you that this technology can be a huge benefit. We spend a great deal of time driving to doctors that aren\u2019t conveniently located only to hear the latest test results. This could easily be done with a video consultation. We also often consult specialists who aren\u2019t local. We moved from the Midwest to the West Coast as a result of a change in employment, and one of our biggest considerations in making the move was changing doctors. We were also involved in a research study at the time and wanted to fulfill our commitment to the doctors. With more frequent use of Telehealth I think we would have seen an avenue to have continuity of care through the move that just didn\u2019t exist at the time. We really didn\u2019t want to give up the knowledge of the care staff that had been with our son from birth. With the research study, we committed to come back a couple of times a year so the doctors could track my son\u2019s progress. With Telehealth, tests could have been conducted locally and results could have been discussed with a patient interview over a video call with the doctor. Telehealth would have allowed the doctor more frequent follow-ups and it would have been much more convenient to the patient. It also would have enabled the new local care staff to come up to speed faster. I also believe as a patient there is an opportunity to have better outcomes because of timelier access to specialists who can apply the highest standards of care associated with their clinical discipline when evaluating a patient. The bottom line is that patients can get the best care with the least inconvenience, and this would be major progress from where we\u2019ve been with our healthcare system. Doctor Benefits As mentioned above, doctors also benefit from being able to extend their reach to patients who aren\u2019t local or who are unable to travel. For specialists, this is a big advantage because local patients can relocate and rural patients have very limited access to specialists. By saving time not traveling between facilities, doctors can increase the number of patients they treat. This benefits the doctor in both quality of life and creates an ability to increase billable time. Doctors can also increase capacity through less travel/weather condition schedule disruptions. Another key advantage of Telehealth, which benefits both the doctor and the patient, is the ability to get a real-time second opinion. Doctors benefit from minimizing a delay in care and also simply sharing knowledge. Patients can feel more confident in an opinion validated by another doctor. For rural doctors, this opens the door to many more resources and reduces professional isolation. It makes it much easier to consult other doctors and also allows them to increase their scope of knowledge. It isn\u2019t just the knowledge gained from working with a broader group of professionals, but also the continuing educational opportunities that the technology creates for rural medical professionals. Health Care System Benefits The reality of healthcare reform is that it provides access to millions of people who were previously uninsured at a time when the number of providers is declining. This creates a need to increase capacity and efficiency. One of the biggest cost reduction opportunities is providing timely access to the right physician that can predict or prevent an adverse event, or at least reduce the chances of adverse events. There is a real case to be made for advancing education for all care specialists with Telehealth. Eliminating travel costs increases the amount of education a healthcare organization can afford. Increasing training makes a medical staff more efficient and reduces costs. It also minimizes the number of times transfers occur due to the knowledge required not being available locally. As far as education is concerned, there is a big difference between watching recorded instruction and actually being able to interact with an instructor live while a course is being conducted. There is a Baylor school of medicine study that indicated that people take away over 600% more knowledge when they are face to face versus voice alone. Imagine the difference if you can both see and interact with the instructor. Telehealth will also minimize ambulance and medical taxi costs and eliminate unnecessary and duplicate tests that are often required to ensure accuracy when a patient is transferred from one site to another. There is also the cost of admissions/readmissions when patients are moved between facilities. It is reported that over one billion dollars is spent on unnecessary hospitalizations each year. To try to reduce excessive facility transportation costs, eleven nursing homes participated in a teleheath study that allowed 24 hour physician support through video conferencing. The report concluded annual savings of over $150,000. An opportunity to reduce staffing costs for rural facilities also exists, as with Telehealth it is now easier to lean on the entire network for support versus staffing locally. Through Telehealth implementation, one health system comprised of nine hospitals, over seventy clinics serving 1.4 million people reported 67 percent reductions in hospitalizations and 68 percent reductions in hospital bed days. Even if staff can\u2019t be reduced it lends itself well to improving the communication between regional facilities. There are less tangible benefits of making rural facilities more attractive to medical professionals who might otherwise move to larger facilities. Continuity of care is also a benefit that is hard to quantify, but well understood to be a huge benefit for medical professionals and patients. Telehealth adoption and other advancements in healthcare communication technology is evident with the recent 7.3 million dollar funding of Augmedix, a healthcare start up that allows doctors to view patient medical records instantly through voice commands using Google Glass. It is clear that Telehealth will have a strong return on investment across the entire healthcare ecosystem. Senior administrative staff are just beginning to understand the potential ROI of this technology, but as they do the velocity of adoption will increase exponentially. I believe when we look back ten years from now we\u2019ll see Telehealth profoundly changed the way healthcare is delivered and viewed.

When global travel restrictions made it impossible for these experts to perform their jobs in person, Outotec accelerated their remote connectivity roadmap. We sat down with Christo Roux, Director of Field and Workshop Services at Outotec to learn more. SightCall: COVID-19 has made a significant impact on most field service operations. Can you tell us more about your company and how you were specifically impacted? Roux: Outotec is a technology provider for mineral processing and refining. To put it into simple terms, once dirt is mined, it needs to be processed in order to be turned into metal. This is where our technology comes into play. Our industry is very specialized which means experts in all of our technologies are few and far between. To help our customers maintain business operations, we must be able to connect those experts with our local field service experts and technicians. COVID-19 greatly impacted our ability to send them into the field. SightCall: In your industry, there must be a lot of complexity around sending experts to the field even under normal circumstances. Was remote support on your roadmap prior to COVID-19? Roux: We\u2019ve always had technical support as part of any service offering. It\u2019s been done by phone or in-person when the situation is too complex. We know that when we have to send someone onsite there will be a delay. I have to emphasize that some of our customers are really remote in locations like the Andes Mountains and the Gobi Desert. They are not close to cities. We have extensive distances to travel and for many of our customers time is money. Whenever we can reduce that downtime, that of course makes them happy. Because of this, remote connectivity was already on our roadmap and we began evaluating remote support platforms in 2019. COVID-19 fast-tracked deployment because it limited our access to sites where we still had delivery obligations. SightCall: How have you deployed remote support in your organization today? Roux: Currently we\u2019ve got two core use cases with remote support using SightCall. The first is an internal use case where we can share expert knowledge with our local field experts and technicians. This keeps us from having to fly people around the world. It is often used for fault finding, installation, and commissioning work \u2013 as well as large capex projects that we need to get up and running. The second use case is direct support to customers. Some customers are very remote and with COVID-19 our ability to travel to them has been restricted. The customer is still onsite and trying to run his operation but then he runs into some technical issues or complications. With SightCall we\u2019re able to provide them with direct technical support and their team can execute based on our instructions. SightCall: Prior to COVID-19 your customers were used to having an expert onsite when a complicated challenge arose. How has their experience been when moving from in-person field service to remote field service? Customers have found remote support to be very helpful. One thing we\u2019ve found that\u2019s made it easy for them to adopt SightCall is the ease with which they can connect to us. Even in remote locations, they\u2019ve found it easy to receive the SMS notification and start the session which has been appealing. No complex software to be installed. For our most remote customers it can take up to a week to send someone onsite. Mine sits require medical clearance. With remote support we can see and help them right away. As I said before, time is money. Click here to learn more about the digitalization of Outotec maintenance services. (Editor\u2019s note: At the time of this interview, Outotec was an independent Finnish technology company. Today Outotec is now Metso:Outotec \u2013 a frontrunner in sustainable technologies, end-to-end solutions and services for the minerals processing, aggregates, metal refining, and recycling industries globally) Ready to get started?

In many cases, technology can seem superfluous. However, as it matures many competitive advantages present themselves. Improvements like cloud storage allowing access to important files across multiple devices and Twitter, which many thought to have no business value is now allowing companies to learn customer pain points in real-time. If it presents an improvement in efficiency inside the company as well as improving a customer\u2019s experience externally, it is a win-win for everyone. For small businesses, improvements in customer satisfaction can mean the difference between survival and becoming another also-ran. As a company grows and has more opportunity to invest in technologies, it can create a clear advantage over competitors and allow the company to separate itself from the pack in the minds of its customers. One technology that has already made its mark in the business world is video. It is back for another round, though, with a focus on customer service this time. For years call centers have been a way for companies to offshore customer service and inflate the bottom line. More recently, however, customers have started to demand more from the companies they do business with and the spotlight has fallen on customer service. Having real help in real time is valuable to customers. American Express and Zappos are two names that often are mentioned with great customer service. Amazon took things to the next level by introducing Mayday, a one-touch video call with a live customer service agent. Of course, the big companies get the big press went they do new, exciting things. That doesn\u2019t mean they are the only ones, though. Many other companies see the writing on the wall and know that providing great customer service boost customer loyalty and improves the bottom line. Here are four small businesses that are using video calling to make life easier for customers and are enjoying the benefits that come with it. One major challenge for small lawyers and law firms is talking to clients who are spread out across a large geographical area. Taking time to meet with clients, especially for the initial consultation, can be a large burden on a lawyer already pressed for time. If a client can\u2019t come into the office for any number of reasons, a lawyer in need of clients is forced to commute, using valuable minutes, even hours, with only the possibility of landing the job. Video conferencing is changing all of that, as the Kennedy-Mighell Report discusses. They cover the challenges they have experienced with video calling clients and the rewarding experience it delivers to both attorney and client. Children of the 1990\u2019s surely remember visits to the bank drive-through fondly. A mysterious voice coming from seemingly nowhere, a space machine-like tube that shot your parents\u2019 information back and forth with that invisible voice, and in the final transaction a treat was there without fail. Visterra Credit Union in Moreno Valley, CA wants to provide that same amazing experience, with a new treat for the adults. When one pulls up to the drive-through carport at Visterra Credit Union aren\u2019t only greeted by a high-tech machine, but there is also a smiling face looking back ready to help with any questions. Automation in customer service has long been the trend but not at this credit union. By providing a live agent to help answer questions, Visterra is able to help customers complete transactions quickly, improve the customer experience, and increase loyalty. And, by using video streaming, the team can all be in one central office while serving all branches as demand ebbs and flows. Customers are able to build a personal relationship with his or her regular teller, but Visterra doesn\u2019t need to staff every location with excess employees. Drive-through banking isn\u2019t the only way to reach customers who need help for banks. North Shore Bank in eastern Wisconsin is delivering the same live agent help through its ATMs. North Shore has branches spread throughout the Milwaukee metropolitan area, but that doesn\u2019t mean a customer can\u2019t see the face of his or her favorite teller if a problem comes up. Instead, North Shore has a team of video tellers in its headquarters in Brookfield ready to assist customers at any ATM. While traffic at physical locations has been in decline for years, due to an increase in internet banking, North Shore still wants to provide customers with the human touch of a local bank no matter where the customer goes. Plus, it reduces the irritation many customers feel when they have to wait in line to speak to a teller as a walk-in customer. Speaking of walking, one of the biggest frustrations with furniture shopping is walking from store to store, comparing prices and trying to compare features from one mattress to the next. Tuft & Needle recognized this problem and decided to start an online shopping store for mattresses. As many other retailers were already in the space, the company needed something else to differentiate from the crowd. The difference is the ability to have a pre-sales video call with an expert. One of the most important decision points when searching for the perfect mattress is testing it out. Doing this online becomes difficult and Tuft & Needle doesn\u2019t disagree with showrooming. However, to help the online customer, it has a live video call option for customers to ask questions and allow the agent to prove the claims made online. Sales and customer loyalty have increased, helping the company become a leader in online mattress sales. There\u2019s an old adage in customer service that a real person, whose smiling face a customer can see, always wins. Why not let technology deliver that smiling face to put a smile on your customer\u2019s face? How could your company incorporate video calls into its customer service offering to improve customer satisfaction?

But in field service, there\u2019s only one wave anybody cares about:\u00a0The Silver Tsunami. That\u2019s the nickname for the massive generational shift that threatens to cut field service off at the knees. It\u2019s supposed to change everything, disrupt business and bring entire industries grinding to a halt. But all is not gloom and doom. The sky is not falling. The end is not so near. Because with the right strategy and mindset, you can turn the Silver Tsunami into a golden opportunity. Yes, it\u2019s a big, scary wave. But there are people who ride big, scary waves for fun every day. And those people understand survival (and success) depends on the right strategy and skills. That\u2019s why, instead of buckling down and bracing for impact, we recommend facing the coming crisis with the courage of a big wave rider. If you put the right plan and processes in place, your organization can harness the momentum of this tsunami and ride it all the way back to the beach. The Coming Storm and the Exodus of Expertise The term Silver Tsunami was coined in the early 2000s to describe the massive retirement wave of the Baby Boomer generation. It\u2019s a workforce milestone that has far-reaching implications for lots of global industries, not just field service. As experienced workers exit, organizations must deal with a decreased headcount and a critical loss of institutional knowledge, technical proficiency, and seasoned leadership. In the field service sector\u2014where hands-on expertise and deep familiarity with complex systems are essential\u2014the Silver Tsunami threatens to devastate workforce readiness and operational continuity. Service organizations face serious obstacles, including: A Seismic Demographic Shift: Baby Boomers, born between 1946 and 1964, are retiring at an accelerating pace, leaving a gap in critical roles that require years of training and experience. Many companies are already struggling to attract fresh talent. Growing Skills Gaps: Younger workers entering the field often lack the hands-on experience needed to handle intricate systems or troubleshoot effectively in high-stakes scenarios. Legacy equipment puts them at a disadvantage. Lack of a Knowledge Transfer Plan: The tacit knowledge that seasoned technicians have\u2014built over decades of on-the-job learning\u2014is difficult to document or transfer easily to new hires. If there\u2019s no preservation plan in place, all that know-how could walk out the door when the employee leaves. Increased Demand for Talent: As industry grows more reliant on field service to support advanced technology, the demand for skilled technicians is outpacing supply. In many parts of the world, pipelines for new service talent are drying up. \u201cBy 2030, all Baby Boomers will be over the age of 65.\u201d \u2013 U.S. Census Bureau Technology + Teamwork = Efficiency The clock is ticking. But the Silver Tsunami situation is not hopeless. Because with the right strategy, teams and technology, there are ways to bridge that knowledge gap between seasoned veterans and the next generation of field technicians. Fortunately, just as millions of skilled workers are leaving their organizations, new technologies have emerged that can act as force multipliers for those who remain. Today\u2019s innovative service teams rely on artificial intelligence (AI), augmented reality (AR) and remote visual support to raise the speed (and quality) of service while lowering the costs of operation. And AI-powered digital automation can reduce and nearly eliminate the most mundane and repetitive tasks, freeing technicians to focus on higher priority jobs and customers. In terms of tools to boost productivity and efficiency, it\u2019s an embarrassment of riches. But the biggest trick for field service leaders is leveraging those tools before it\u2019s too late. Watch a Demo Video of SightCall VISION The 3 Keys to Capturing Expert Knowledge (without getting wet) Great surfers make it look easy, but nobody was born standing on a board. Learning to ride a wave takes work, whether it\u2019s an 80-footer off the coast of Maui or a talent crisis that\u2019s headed straight for your commercial printing division. It\u2019s a journey and a process that you take one ride at a time. Ask a veteran surfer how to get better and you\u2019ll probably hear: Choose the right gear. Be patient and persistent. Never stop learning. It\u2019s not much different for field service leaders faced with the biggest wave of retirements in decades. 1. Choose the Right Gear: Use Technology to Bridge Knowledge Gaps You\u2019d better believe that the best surfers in the world get picky when it comes to boards. The right equipment matters, even if it\u2019s just a pair of swim trunks. The same goes for field service. Any team that isn\u2019t diving headfirst into the 21st-century technology pool is just treading water. Digital tools today make it easier than ever to capture, retain, and share the practical wisdom held by veteran workers. Here are some solutions that service leaders can implement to soften the impact of the Silver Tsunami: Remote Visual Support: Visual support tools allow younger technicians to access real-time guidance from experienced workers, even post-retirement. By enabling live, visual \u2018over-the-shoulder\u2019 mentorship, new techs can learn as they go, with expert advice on hand. Knowledge Management Systems: These systems store best practices, step-by-step tutorials, and field notes in a centralized, searchable database. This is a digital \u2018knowledge library\u2019 that ensures critical information is always accessible. Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR): AR and VR provide immersive training experiences, replicating field conditions so that new technicians can practice complex tasks with guidance from seasoned professionals. Mobile Apps with Knowledge Checkpoints: Mobile tools let techs access procedures, review steps, and ensure they\u2019re on the right path, providing just-in-time knowledge in the field. 2. Be Patient and Persistent: Take One Wave at a Time Wipeouts happen. But instead of packing it in, true pros paddle back out and try again. While riding a wave and repairing an MRI machine are worlds apart, nothing good ever comes from giving up. Replacing experts with novices takes time. The key is to take advantage of every job, every call and every challenge during the transition period. Teach and learn one step at a time. Keep all that hard-earned know-how in house with some of these tactics: Peer-to-Peer Mentorship Programs: Pair new techs with experienced ones, allowing them to learn from firsthand experience. Rotate mentors to give new hires a broader skill set. Document-as-You-Go Method: Encourage veterans to document processes while they work. This method captures not only \u2018what\u2019 they do but \u2018why\u2019 they do it. On-the-Job \u201cShadow\u201d Training with Remote Assistance: Set up sessions where experienced techs guide new hires remotely, offering real-time problem-solving support. Gamification of Knowledge Sharing: Use a points or rewards system to encourage sharing of expertise, transforming knowledge transfer into a fun, engaging activity. 3. Never Stop Learning: Establish a Culture of Trading Knowledge Veteran surfers can tell what\u2019s coming just by watching the wind on the water. That kind of insight only comes from years in the ocean. In service, sharing tips and tricks acquired through decades in the field can give fresh recruits a leg up and shorten those long (and expensive) learning curves. The fastest shortcut to mastery starts with sharing: Foster a Culture of Learning: Encourage all generations to participate in skill-building and knowledge sharing, create a workplace where learning is valued at every level. Recognize and Reward Contributors: Celebrate both veterans who share expertise and new hires who quickly absorb and apply it. Celebrate Wins: Highlight successes where knowledge transfer led to project success or a solved problem. Why \u201cWait and See\u201d is a Recipe for Disaster The Silver Tsunami is coming. The numbers are scary, and the workforce gaps are daunting. The field service industry is going to take a direct hit. And if \u201ccoming up with a plan\u201d is still on your to-do list, you\u2019ve got your work cut out for you. The window of opportunity is closing, but it\u2019s not too late to swap your \u201cdo nothing\u201d strategy for a commitment \u201cdo something\u201d now. There are visionary tools that make it easier than ever to build momentum and efficiency for your next generation workforce. By capturing knowledge from veteran workers and using technology to smooth the transition, service leaders can prevent costly disruptions and setbacks in service. Don\u2019t let years of wisdom get washed away; start implementing these strategies and tactics now to ensure your team is ready for the future. All you need to do is raise your hand to get started.

Thanks to the likes of Amazon, Uber, and Deliveroo, today\u2019s consumer expects 24/7 service. With a culture of instant gratification and as people\u2019s lives get busier, consumers want their problems fixed almost instantly, on their own terms, and at a time that\u2019s convenient for them. As a direct result of changing customer expectations, many organizations, including insurance companies and third-party adjusters, are offering self-service options for initiating claims in order to shorten claims life cycles while increasing efficiency and customer satisfaction. What is Digital Process Automation? Automation is changing the way certain tasks get done and how service organizations can scale and evolve the way they do business, as well as the expectations of your customers and the options they are provided around service. Digital Process Automation (DPA) is a way to digitize any business process by using software to automate and optimize common workflows. By creating a Digital Flow for policyholders to complete, insurance organizations can provide step-by-step guidance to collect needed information during the claims process. Self-Service Claims Fully customizable Digital Flows for claims can be created by insurers and shared with their policyholders via a QR code in their policy, via text or email link, or from a website chat bot. Processes like the first notification of loss (FNOL) can be fully digitized to offer self-service options with support. Any policyholder can access and complete a Digital Flow on their mobile device by following a series of prompts and questions to collect all needed information. When the Digital Flow is completed, everything needed to process the claim has been collected including geo-location data, HD photos and videos. All forms, signatures, location data and media are automatically uploaded into the claims file for review. If a policyholder needs help at any point during the self-service process, they can immediately escalate to a live visual claims session where a trained adjuster can help them gather the information through a live video feed. Digital Process Automation with SightCall Digital Flows SightCall Digital Flows is the most advanced digital process automation solution for visual, self-guided task execution. SightCall\u2019s platform transforms the claim experience into an enhanced customer experience that empowers the policyholder, streamlines data collection, and allows insurers to effectively and accurately allocate resources. Digital Flows can be fully integrated and connected to other systems and partners within the insurers\u2019 ecosystem, ensuring the policyholder is being supported correctly based on the information they are providing. Common Insurance Use Cases for Digital Process Automation Digital Process Automation (DPA) for FNOL Collect all necessary information from the policyholder to start a claim. With SightCall Digital Flows, most information around the policyholder\u2019s details including name, address, policy number, etc. is automatically pulled through into the Digital Flow for the policyholder to check and accept. They can then initiate a claim and collect the information needed. Digital Process Automation (DPA) for Claims The policyholder can document and share all relevant information around a claim directly from a Digital Flow. They can take photos, share videos, upload OCR readings, verify their location and more, directly through the Digital Flow. All collected information is pushed back into the insurers existing systems, such as a CRM. If they need help during the claims process, they can immediately escalate to a live video support session with an adjuster who can guide them to finish the process. Digital Process Automation (DPA) for Claims Fulfilment During the fulfillment phase of a claim, all relevant work can be captured, documented, and even assessed through a Digital Flow, ensuring the relevant evidence of completed work is captured for audit. Digital Process Automation (DPA) for Underwriting Inspections Even before a policy had been taken out by a customer, they can take advantage of a digital flow through an underwriting inspection, to correctly capture all the necessary information they need in order to receive an accurate premium cost. A Fully Customizable Experience Digital Flows can be created, defined, and customized to fit both the specific needs of your insurance organization as well as the look and feel of your brand. Here is an example of how an express insurance claim can occur using SightCall Digital Flows: Customer Snapshot This Claims Management organization now uses SightCall Digital Flows to streamline their processes and accurately capture data during the fulfillment phase of a claim. Improperly performed work can lead to costly penalties to the business, especially when image-based evidence of the work carried out during fulfillment is not properly documented and saved. Through using SightCall Digital Flows the customer has digitized their contractor overview process, with information and related videos for audit readily available and saved within their CRM. Read the full case study here. Benefits of SightCall Digital Flows for Insurance Organizations Streamlined and Standardized Processes All information from a claim can be collected through a pre-defined set of forms that can be reviewed by an expert adjuster or during a fulfillment audit. This reduces human errors and reduces the likelihood of any critical information being missed or lost during the claims or fulfillment process. Increased Efficiency for Adjusters Adjusters can waste up to 5 minutes on each call they have with a policyholder who is trying to find their policy details. With SightCall Digital Flows, you can almost eliminate this lost time, so that adjusters have more time to focus on a claim, speeding up the entire process, minimizing costs, and providing a faster, smarter experience for the customer Faster Claims With a more streamlined process, the entire claims lifecycle can be faster and more efficient, allowing the insurer to effectively allocate and use resources while ensuring that the policyholder\u2019s experience is both modern and fast.

What is Remote Support? SightCall What is Remote Support? Remote support, also called remote assistance and remote visual assistance, allows service organizations to provide technical help to customers and technicians in the field remotely via live video, reducing the need to send workers into the field. In addition to live video, remote support platforms provide augmented reality tools that make it easy to collaboratively solve problems and integrations that enable seamless data collection within existing CSM or FSM systems. Remote Support vs Video Chat Consumer video chat services like Zoom and Facetime connect people and are useful for conversational interactions and presentations. When trying to solve a complex or technical problem from a distance adding video chat is only marginally helpful. Visual assistance technology such as the SightCall platform offers features that give remote support providers the tools they need to observe, document, and solve problems for their users. Customers or technicians in the field can use smartphones, tablets, or other mobile devices to get immediate expert help by joining a remote support session. Rather than using the front-facing camera of mobile device, remote support primarily makes use of the back camera. Remote Support Features that Solve Problems Through a live session, the end-user can use their smartphone to show the remote expert what they are seeing. The remote expert can use tools to zoom in, activate the flashlight, pause the live video, and use AR annotations to add instructions and tools over real-world objects to illustrate steps and reduce confusion. Other features allow agents to perform accurate measurements remotely, scan codes, import information such as serial numbers and readings, and capture GPS coordinates. The result is a toolkit that provides rich information to remote experts and empowers them to solve problems along with the users during a live video session. Watch a Demo Video of SightCall VISION Use Cases for Remote Support The applications of remote support are universal. Customer service organizations use it to help their customers troubleshoot problems and self-service. If a technician is needed, they benefit from knowing exactly what a problem is and what\u2019s needed to fix it. Similarly, field service organizations use visual assistance to conduct remote video inspections and help technicians on the ground perform maintenance and repairs by dialing in remote specialists. In the healthcare industry, visual assistance tools provide a secure platform for telehealth with additional features for remote help with maintaining healthcare equipment for providers and patients at home. For insurers, using remote support for visual claims allow policyholders to document their claims with a remote adjuster verifying data in real-time. Choosing the Right Remote Support Platform When adding remote support to your organization\u2019s services, it\u2019s important to choose a platform that addresses your needs and integrates into your existing workflows with minimum disruption. One of the most important criteria in a remote support platform is a flexible integration system that allows data synchronization between your Customer Relationship or Field Service Management systems with the remote support platform. This allows all resources, such as photos, videos, and information about issues and their resolutions to be saved right inside a case file. The right solution will offer several deployment options that meet your needs, whether that is a platform that can be integrated into existing service apps or one that operates as a stand-alone remote support application. The SightCall Difference In addition to providing all of these powerful features to our customers, we also manage and operate our global network of real-time platform nodes that are connected through high bandwidth connections. This ensures that no matter where the remote expert is, they can help solve problems anywhere else in the world. Are You Struggling with Traditional Support?

As experienced technicians retire, they\u2019re taking decades of expertise with them. Volumes of practical knowledge and valuable insights gathered over hundreds (or thousands) of service calls go walking out the front door. You can\u2019t afford to let that happen. Making matters worse, many short-handed service organizations are forced to accelerate training and steepen the learning curve for raw recruits. But throwing beginners into the deep end does nothing to close the knowledge gap. New technicians face complex problems without the depth of know-how they need. It\u2019s a never-ending loop of loss. Poor preparation mixed with high expectations only ends in frustration. And thus the gap persists, leading to higher operational costs, massive inefficiencies, and, unfortunately, unhappy customers. A recent study found that 70% of corporate leaders recognize a critical skills gap in their organizations, impacting business performance. This challenge is particularly pressing in field service where knowledge is often tacit or \u201ctribal\u201d\u2014learned on the job, rather than from a manual. But the challenge is not insurmountable, and IT leaders are in a unique position to help capture this expertise, make it accessible, scalable, and ready to adapt to future tech. Watch a Video Demo of SightCall VISION for Field Service The Knowledge Gap in Field Service In the fast-paced world of field service, capturing and expanding your team\u2019s knowledge has never been more important. As new technologies reshape how we work, IT leaders play a vital role in helping their organizations gather, organize, and scale the expertise that keeps operations running smoothly. With the rise of Multimodal Generative AI, field service is being revolutionized. It\u2019s easier than ever for companies to move beyond one-dimensional text manuals for service knowledge. This guide will walk you through the steps IT leaders like you can take to build a future-proof knowledge base, making sure all those valuable insights don\u2019t retire along with your experts. Step 1: Start Capturing Knowledge Now This step is all about building a solid foundation of information that your future knowledge base can stand on. The more detailed and organized you make this foundation now, the bigger your knowledge base can grow. Actionable Tips for IT Leaders: Implement Comprehensive Recording Tools: Think of capturing field service interactions as gathering materials to build with\u2014not just the big pieces like videos, but the smaller, detailed parts like transcriptions, notes, and augmented reality (AR) annotations. This combination of data is like assembling a toolkit with every possible tool you might need down the road. The richer and more varied your \u201cmaterials,\u201d the more possibilities you\u2019ll have when it\u2019s time to build. Standardize Data Collection: Your data needs to be collected in a consistent, organized way. Setting standards for tagging and organizing data is like labeling each piece so you know exactly where it goes. This consistency makes it much easier for future AI tools to analyze and learn from the data. Future-Proof Your Foundation: By starting to capture this data now, you\u2019re not just storing information for today\u2014you\u2019re laying the groundwork for a powerful, AI-ready knowledge base that can grow and improve over time. On average, an organization\u2019s lowest-performing technicians cost 86% more than the top-performing technicians. \u2014Aquant, 2023 Medical Device Benchmark Report Step 2: Organize and Categorize Raw data is valuable, but organized data is powerful. Once you\u2019ve begun capturing interactions, the next step is to categorize and structure it, making it easy to search, analyze, and use in practical ways. This step describes turning raw data into a well-organized library that is easy for anyone to explore and use effectively. Just like a library needs shelves, categories, and labels to help people find what they\u2019re looking for, your knowledge base needs a clear system to make the data useful. Actionable Tips for IT Leaders: Develop a Taxonomy: Work with field service experts to brainstorm and create a structured way to categorize information. Think about what would be useful: for example, by equipment type, problem type, or solution steps. This makes it easier for technicians to find exactly what they need, when they need it. Leverage Metadata: Adding things like timestamps, equipment details, and location make it easier to find specific information. For example, if you need to locate data about a specific piece of equipment in a particular region, metadata lets you jump straight to it, saving time and making searches more accurate. Metadata also goes a long way towards improving the accuracy and speed of future AI analysis. Use Data Management and Processing Tools: Keeping your library organized is no small task, so investing in data management tools is like hiring a team of librarians who automatically label, organize, and categorize each piece of data as it comes in. These tools can handle large amounts of data and prepare it for AI analysis, making sure everything stays neat and searchable as your collection grows. Remember: By organizing your data thoughtfully, you\u2019re setting the stage for deeper, AI-powered insights, that make knowledge more accessible for future generations of field technicians and engineers. Step 3: Leverage AI for Analysis Here\u2019s where your knowledge base starts to shine. Once you\u2019ve captured and organized your data, AI can extract patterns, identify trends, and offer insights that improve operations. Actionable Tips for IT Leaders: Deploy AI Models: Use AI models to help analyze your multimodal data interaction data. AI can quickly extract trends, such as common troubleshooting methods or recurring equipment issues. Think of AI as a detective diving into your data\u2014watching past cases, finding patterns, and spotting trends. AI can tell you things like, \u201cHey, this part seems to break a lot,\u201d or \u201cThese steps usually solve the problem quickly.\u201d Implement Continuous Learning: Structure your AI project to improve over time and always have human-in-the-loop feedback, adapting as new data is introduced. Each new piece of data is like a lesson, where humans should guide AI to help it get smarter and more accurate. So, the insights it provides get better and better, like a tech who\u2019s worked on hundreds of similar machines and knows just what to look for. This is where traditional knowledge systems like online folders full of hard-to-read PDFs, piles of bulky paper manuals, and expertise from your top service people start transforming into something remarkable. All that interaction data you\u2019ve gathered turns into \u201cliving\u201d structured knowledge that augments your traditional knowledge sources with tacit expertise. 87% of companies worldwide report skill gaps or expect them within a few years \u2014McKinsey, 2022 Step 4: Create Interactive Guides Once AI has helped you extract valuable insights, you can start packaging them into interactive, easy-to-use visual guides for technicians in the field. These guides should be simple, flexible, and ready to adapt to whatever a technician needs at the moment. Actionable Tips for IT Leaders: Develop AI-Enhanced Guides: Imagine each technician has a personal assistant who can show and tell them what they need for each job. They can pull up a custom set of multimodal instructions tailored to the specific equipment they\u2019re working on. The guide might show videos, highlight parts using AR, or walk them through step-by-step instructions, adjusting as needed based on the task at hand. Enable Access on Mobile and Wearable Devices: Make sure guides are available on smartphones, tablets, and wearable devices, allowing technicians to access help hands-free and in real time. Incorporate Technician Feedback: Create a feedback loop where technicians can suggest improvements to the guides, keeping them accurate, relevant, and helpful. Interactive guides empower technicians by giving them instant access to expertise, boosting efficiency and improving service quality. Step 5: Iterate and Improve The final step is to treat your knowledge base as a living resource, constantly updated and improved as new insights and data come in. Just like a garden, it\u2019s never \u201cdone,\u201d it gets better the more you put into it. Actionable Tips for IT Leaders: Set Up Continuous Improvement Processes: Regularly update your taxonomy, refine AI models, and improve interactive guides based on user feedback. Listening to feedback from technicians in the field will help you keep things fresh and relevant. Measure Impact: Track metrics like time-to-resolution, first-time fix rates, and technician satisfaction to gauge the effectiveness of your knowledge base. Use these metrics to help you understand where things are going well or where you need to make changes. Stay Ahead of New Tech: You should be ready to adopt tech advances\u2014like better AI, AR, or Internet of Things (IoT) devices\u2014that can make your knowledge base even more effective. An evolving knowledge base is a long-term investment. With regular care, it becomes an even more valuable resource, adapting as your organization grows and evolves. U.S. employers will soon face the largest labor shortage the country has ever seen, with a deficit of six million workers by 2032 \u2014Lightcast The Future is VISUAL\u2014and It Starts Now For IT leaders, the path forward in field service should focus on harnessing knowledge: capturing it, analyzing it, and making it accessible for the entire team. With tools like SightCall VISION and multimodal Generative AI, you can build a knowledge base that goes beyond simply storing past experiences\u2014it strengthens your organization\u2019s expertise over time. Your knowledge base is more than just a collection of past solutions; it\u2019s the bedrock of your organization\u2019s future. By taking these proactive steps, you\u2019re setting your team up for success in a field service environment that\u2019s constantly changing. So, where will you begin? The journey to a smarter, more connected field service operation starts with capturing the knowledge that will drive tomorrow\u2019s successes.

Technicians and onsite customers frequently work in challenging locations such as basements, rural sites, hospitals, data centers, and remote industrial facilities, where cellular and Wi-Fi signals can be weak or entirely unavailable. In these environments, capturing accurate visual and asset data in real-time becomes increasingly difficult\u2014negatively impacting service quality and customer satisfaction. SightCall addresses these specific service delivery challenges with Offline Data Capture, a robust capability within Remote Visual Support. Offline Data Capture enables onsite customers and field technicians to effectively document critical information without immediate network access. Once connectivity is restored, this newly captured data can be seamlessly shared with remote support agents, who can then continue guiding technicians and customers toward swift issue resolution. Service leaders prioritize uninterrupted workflow capabilities to meet growing customer demands for immediate and accurate issue resolution ( ServiceCouncil ). Offline Data Capture directly supports this strategic imperative by ensuring uninterrupted data collection and enhanced troubleshooting in any connectivity scenario. How SightCall\u2019s Offline Data Capture Works When an onsite customer or field technician encounters an environment with limited or no connectivity, such as a basement, rural location, data center, or hospital, the Remote Visual Support agent remotely activates SightCall\u2019s Offline Data Capture capability. This enables the technician or customer to independently gather critical visual context while offline, ensuring detailed, accurate information capture without delay or disruption. Offline Data Capture integrates two primary functionalities: Barcode Scanner (2D & Data Matrix) Technicians and onsite customers can scan barcodes from equipment or assets directly through the SightCall application without network connectivity. This facilitates immediate documentation of equipment identifiers, product models, inventory, and service history. Upon reconnecting, all barcode data instantly syncs and becomes accessible to the remote agent. Local Photo Capture High-resolution photographs can be securely captured and stored locally on the technician\u2019s or customer\u2019s device while offline. These detailed visuals document site conditions, equipment statuses, compliance information, or potential damage. Once reconnected, images automatically upload into the support session, allowing the remote agent immediate review and action. Seamless Continuation of Remote Support The value of SightCall\u2019s Offline Data Capture is magnified once connectivity resumes. As soon as the technician or customer reconnects to the network, all offline-collected barcode data and photos sync automatically. The remote visual support agent immediately accesses this new context, reviews the detailed offline data, and efficiently resumes the troubleshooting session. By equipping remote agents with this enriched context, SightCall empowers support teams to provide precise, informed guidance, leading to significantly faster issue resolution and improved service outcomes. Who Benefits Most from Offline Data Capture? Onsite Customers and End Users Customers gain confidence and autonomy, able to capture essential visual and asset details offline before reconnecting with remote agents. This reduces frustration, accelerates troubleshooting, and enhances overall service satisfaction. Field Technicians Technicians operating in connectivity-challenged environments such as basements, rural sites, or remote facilities confidently collect critical documentation and asset data offline. With the captured data instantly available upon reconnection, they significantly reduce onsite delays and repeat visits. Remote Visual Support Agents Support agents actively initiate Offline Data Capture when encountering connectivity disruptions. Upon reconnection, they receive comprehensive, accurate data\u2014enabling quicker diagnosis, informed decision-making, and better troubleshooting outcomes. Operations and IT Leaders With seamless integration into enterprise service management platforms (like Salesforce, ServiceMax, Genesys, NICE, or Dynamics), leaders gain greater visibility into offline-collected service data, improving compliance, efficiency, and informed decision-making. Proven Value and Measurable Impacts Organizations leveraging SightCall\u2019s Offline Data Capture capability consistently report measurable improvements across key operational and service delivery metrics: Improved First-Time Fix Rates With comprehensive offline data capture, technicians arrive prepared, significantly reducing repeat visits and operational costs.

The result? A second visit, a frustrated customer, and a service team that feels like it\u2019s playing catch-up. These are exactly the kinds of moments AI is built to prevent. AI is no longer just a promising idea\u2014it\u2019s a working tool in the field, embedded into service workflows, helping leaders cut downtime, support technicians in real time, and improve customer outcomes across the board. In fact, companies using AI to support field operations are seeing up to a 30% improvement in first-time fix rates, a metric that directly impacts cost, productivity, and morale. At Field Service Palm Springs 2025, I had the opportunity to moderate a panel with leaders from industries as varied as telecom, manufacturing, safety, and supply chain logistics. Our goal was to explore the next level of AI\u2014not just pilot projects or isolated wins, but scalable, reliable applications that solve real service problems. What followed was a conversation packed with insight. These were not blue-sky ideas. We talked about improving time-to-resolution, training AI on 3,000-page manuals, integrating AI into ticketing systems, and even tying remote diagnostics to service contract value. But perhaps the most important takeaway was this: the companies leading the way with AI in field service aren\u2019t treating it like magic\u2014 they\u2019re treating it like a teammate. And they\u2019re seeing results because of it. Here are three key themes and takeaways from that session\u2014and a few of my own thoughts on how AI is helping shape the next era of service excellence. Solving Real Service Problems: First-Time Fix, Uptime, and Field Morale We started the session with a question I believe every service leader should ask: What problem are you trying to solve with AI? Stephen, with Mettler Toledo, put it plainly: \u201cCustomer uptime is probably the most critical thing we can do. But we want to do that in the most cost-effective way for ourselves.\u201d That tension\u2014between rising service expectations and the pressure to contain costs\u2014is one that almost every organization is facing today. His team is laser-focused on reducing unnecessary second visits, often caused by missing parts or skill gaps. \u201cIf we do enough in the front end, we can send the right technician, with the right part, and get the job done the first time. That\u2019s how we generate capacity organically\u2014we\u2019re not sending someone back to the same job twice.\u201d This isn\u2019t just about numbers. It\u2019s about pride. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing worse than going on site, starting the job, and realizing you can\u2019t finish it,\u201d Stephen said. \u201cIt impacts morale. Technicians want to do a good job. They feel it when they can\u2019t.\u201d This resonated deeply with me. At SightCall, we\u2019ve seen how empowering technicians with remote expertise and visual guidance dramatically boosts first-time fix rates. But it also does something more subtle\u2014it gives technicians the confidence and dignity they deserve. Watch a Demo of SightCall VISION for Field Service Speed to Value and the ROI Conversation From there, we explored how these initiatives translate into return on investment. It\u2019s a complex subject, often made harder by the intangible nature of some AI benefits. Clinten, whose company serves the waste optimization industry, emphasized the importance of focusing on the right outcomes. \u201cThe CFO wants to see ROI,\u201d he said, \u201cbut you also need to articulate the real-world problems you\u2019re trying to fix.\u201d For them, reducing travel costs through remote support has been a significant win\u2014saving both internal costs and customer expense. Jeff, representing the fleet safety sector, framed it beautifully: \u201cWe\u2019re not just saving lives and assets\u2014we\u2019re saving dreams.\u201d His AI-powered cameras detect fatigue, distraction, and risky driving behaviors in real time. This not only prevents accidents, but also strengthens compliance and reduces insurance costs. I was particularly impressed by how Greg from Ciena broke down their approach. They began with their highest-volume product and used AI to improve time-to-resolution in their support center. \u201cWe saw a direct correlation between case resolution time and CSAT scores,\u201d he said. \u201cThat gave us the confidence to expand AI to other product lines.\u201d Greg also shared a great example of monetization: by offering remote diagnostics only to customers with service contracts, his team has turned AI into a value-added feature that helps sell more contracts and drive loyalty. That\u2019s what I call a win-win: better customer experience, more revenue, and greater operational efficiency. From my perspective, this is a playbook more companies need to follow. AI should be tied to outcomes that matter\u2014 reducing downtime, improving fix rates, or driving contract value. And then we track those outcomes relentlessly. That\u2019s how you make the case not just to finance, but to the entire business. Trust and Accuracy: The Human + AI Model Perhaps the most nuanced part of the discussion was around trust. It\u2019s one thing to deploy AI; it\u2019s another to get people to use it, believe it, and benefit from it. Clinten described how his team designed their workflows to keep humans in the loop. \u201cIf a field tech is staring at a 3,000-page manual, AI can help them find the right section instantly. But if that doesn\u2019t solve the issue, it escalates to a support engineer, who guides the AI.\u201d That hybrid model ensures quality, avoids rabbit holes, and builds user confidence over time. Greg shared a similar journey at Ciena. Initially, they used AI internally to suggest knowledge articles: \u201cOnly after we saw accuracy improve did we expose those recommendations to customers\u2014and even then, only from vetted articles.\u201d As a result, their case avoidance rate increased by over 10%, now hovering around 50% \u2014a massive boost in efficiency. Stephen offered an important caution: \u201cAI can\u2019t be a crutch. It has to be part of a blended approach. We still invest heavily in technician training. The app is there if you get stuck\u2014but it\u2019s not the first thing you reach for.\u201d I couldn\u2019t agree more. AI is not a shortcut\u2014it\u2019s a multiplier. But to multiply human skill, you need a strong baseline. That\u2019s why I\u2019m a big believer in \u201chuman-first AI.\u201d We must keep our subject matter experts, trainers, and field leaders involved\u2014not just in reviewing content, but in shaping how AI is deployed and continuously improved. A Roadmap for Responsible Innovation What made this panel so valuable was the honesty. No one claimed to have all the answers. But they\u2019re asking the right questions. They\u2019re starting small, measuring carefully, and building systems that balance efficiency with empathy. At SightCall, we work with organizations every day who are figuring this out in real time. The ones that succeed have a few things in common: They start with the problem, not the tech. They measure what matters\u2014fix rate, CSAT, uptime\u2014not vanity metrics. They invest in people just as much as in platforms. And they stay agile\u2014ready to pivot, improve, and learn. As I said to our audience in Palm Springs, \u201cAI isn\u2019t here to replace technicians\u2014it\u2019s here to support them. When we design with that mindset, we unlock not just better service\u2014but better organizations.\u201d Thanks to everyone who joined the discussion. And if you\u2019re on your own AI journey in field service, I\u2019d love to hear what you\u2019re learning.

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence the version number 2.1.] Preamble The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software\u2013to make sure the software is free for all its users. This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software packages\u2013typically libraries\u2013of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below. When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things. To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it. For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library. To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original version, so that the original author\u2019s reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others. Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license. Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs. When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library. We call this license the \u201cLesser\u201d General Public License because it does Less to protect the user\u2019s freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special circumstances. For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License. In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system. Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users\u2019 freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library. The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a \u201cwork based on the library\u201d and a \u201cwork that uses the library\u201d. The former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to run. TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called \u201cthis License\u201d). Each licensee is addressed as \u201cyou\u201d. A \u201clibrary\u201d means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables. The \u201cLibrary\u201d, below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A \u201cwork based on the Library\u201d means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \u201cmodification\u201d.) \u201cSource code\u201d for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library. Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does. 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library\u2019s complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library. You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: a) The modified work must itself be a software library. b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change. c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License. d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful. These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library. In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License. 3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices. Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy. This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library. 4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange. If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code. 5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a \u201cwork that uses the Library\u201d. Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License. However, linking a \u201cwork that uses the Library\u201d with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a \u201cwork that uses the library\u201d. The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables. When a \u201cwork that uses the Library\u201d uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law. If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.) Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself. 6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a \u201cwork that uses the Library\u201d with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer\u2019s own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications. You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things: a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \u201cwork that uses the Library\u201d, as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.) b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user\u2019s computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with. c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution. d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place. e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy. For an executable, the required form of the \u201cwork that uses the Library\u201d must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable. It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute. 7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things: a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above. b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work. 8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. 9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it. 10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients\u2019 exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License. 11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library. If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice. This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License. 12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License. 13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \u201cany later version\u201d, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. 14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally. NO WARRANTY 15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \u201cAS IS\u201d WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public License). To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \u201ccopyright\u201d line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. one line to give the library\u2019s name and an idea of what it does. Copyright (C) year name of author This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version. This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU Lesser General Public License for more details. You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail. You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a \u201ccopyright disclaimer\u201d for the library, if necessary.

GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3, 29 June 2007 Copyright \u00a9 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed. This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below. Additional Definitions. As used herein, \u201cthis License\u201d refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the \u201cGNU GPL\u201d refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License. \u201cThe Library\u201d refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below. An \u201cApplication\u201d is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library. A \u201cCombined Work\u201d is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the \u201cLinked Version\u201d. The \u201cMinimal Corresponding Source\u201d for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version. The \u201cCorresponding Application Code\u201d for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work. 1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL. You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL. 2. Conveying Modified Versions. If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version: a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy. 4. Combined Works. You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following: a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document. c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document. d) Do one of the following: 0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source. 1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user\u2019s computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version. Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.) 5. Combined Libraries. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following: a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License. b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work. 6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License \u201cor any later version\u201d applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.

GCC RUNTIME LIBRARY EXCEPTION Version 3.1, 31 March 2009 Copyright \u00a9 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc. http://fsf.org/ Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed. This GCC Runtime Library Exception (\u201cException\u201d) is an additional permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version 3 (\u201cGPLv3\u201d). It applies to a given file (the \u201cRuntime Library\u201d) that bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception. When you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception. 1. Definitions. A file is an \u201cIndependent Module\u201d if it either requires the Runtime Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based on the Runtime Library. \u201cGCC\u201d means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any subsequent versions published by the FSF. \u201cGPL-compatible Software\u201d is software whose conditions of propagation, modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with the license of GCC. \u201cTarget Code\u201d refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used for producing a compiler intermediate representation. The \u201cCompilation Process\u201d transforms code entirely represented in non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example, use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be understood as starting with the output of the generators or preprocessors. A Compilation Process is \u201cEligible\u201d if it is done using GCC, alone or with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an Eligible Compilation Process. 2. Grant of Additional Permission. You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice, consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules. 3. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft. The availability of this Exception does not imply any general presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft requirements of the license of GCC. libSRTP The srtp library and the test drivers distributed with it are licensed under the following BSD-based license.

You are welcome to redistribute this software and to use it for any purpose, subject to the conditions under LEGAL ISSUES, below. Serious users of this software (particularly those incorporating it into larger programs) should contact IJG at [email\u00a0protected] to be added to our electronic mailing list. Mailing list members are notified of updates and have a chance to participate in technical discussions, etc. This software is the work of Tom Lane, Philip Gladstone, Jim Boucher, Lee Crocker, Julian Minguillon, Luis Ortiz, George Phillips, Davide Rossi, Guido Vollbeding, Ge\u2019 Weijers, and other members of the Independent JPEG Group. IJG is not affiliated with the official ISO JPEG standards committee. OVERVIEW This package contains C software to implement JPEG image compression and decompression. JPEG (pronounced \u201cjay-peg\u201d) is a standardized compression method for full-color and gray-scale images. JPEG is intended for compressing \u201creal-world\u201d scenes; line drawings, cartoons and other non-realistic images are not its strong suit. JPEG is lossy, meaning that the output image is not exactly identical to the input image. Hence you must not use JPEG if you have to have identical output bits. However, on typical photographic images, very good compression levels can be obtained with no visible change, and remarkably high compression levels are possible if you can tolerate a low-quality image. For more details, see the references, or just experiment with various compression settings. This software implements JPEG baseline, extended-sequential, and progressive compression processes. Provision is made for supporting all variants of these processes, although some uncommon parameter settings aren\u2019t implemented yet. For legal reasons, we are not distributing code for the arithmetic-coding variants of JPEG; see LEGAL ISSUES. We have made no provision for supporting the hierarchical or lossless processes defined in the standard. We provide a set of library routines for reading and writing JPEG image files, plus two sample applications \u201ccjpeg\u201d and \u201cdjpeg\u201d, which use the library to perform conversion between JPEG and some other popular image file formats. The library is intended to be reused in other applications. In order to support file conversion and viewing software, we have included considerable functionality beyond the bare JPEG coding/decoding capability; for example, the color quantization modules are not strictly part of JPEG decoding, but they are essential for output to colormapped file formats or colormapped displays. These extra functions can be compiled out of the library if not required for a particular application. We have also included \u201cjpegtran\u201d, a utility for lossless transcoding between different JPEG processes, and \u201crdjpgcom\u201d and \u201cwrjpgcom\u201d, two simple applications for inserting and extracting textual comments in JFIF files. The emphasis in designing this software has been on achieving portability and flexibility, while also making it fast enough to be useful. In particular, the software is not intended to be read as a tutorial on JPEG. (See the REFERENCES section for introductory material.) Rather, it is intended to be reliable, portable, industrial-strength code. We do not claim to have achieved that goal in every aspect of the software, but we strive for it. We welcome the use of this software as a component of commercial products. No royalty is required, but we do ask for an acknowledgement in product documentation, as described under LEGAL ISSUES. LEGAL ISSUES In plain English: 1. We don\u2019t promise that this software works. (But if you find any bugs, please let us know!) 2. You can use this software for whatever you want. You don\u2019t have to pay us. 3. You may not pretend that you wrote this software. If you use it in a program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that you\u2019ve used the IJG code. In legalese: The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied, with respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose. This software is provided \u201cAS IS\u201d, and you, its user, assume the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy. This software is copyright (C) 1991-1998, Thomas G. Lane. All Rights Reserved except as specified below. Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these conditions: (1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation. (2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying documentation must state that \u201cthis software is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG Group\u201d. (3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind. These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code, not just to the unmodified library. If you use our work, you ought to acknowledge us. Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author\u2019s name or company name in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from it. This software may be referred to only as \u201cthe Independent JPEG Group\u2019s software\u201d. We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are assumed by the product vendor. ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch, sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA. ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally, that you must include source code if you redistribute it. (See the file ansi2knr.c for full details.) However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than the foregoing paragraphs do. The Unix configuration script \u201cconfigure\u201d was produced with GNU Autoconf. It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable. The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub, ltconfig, ltmain.sh). Another support script, install-sh, is copyright by M.I.T. but is also freely distributable. It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi. Hence arithmetic coding cannot legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses. For this reason, support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG software. (Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many implementations will support it.) So far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining code. The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files. To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce \u201cuncompressed GIFs\u201d. This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard GIF decoders. We are required to state that \u201cThe Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of CompuServe Incorporated. GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of CompuServe Incorporated.\u201d Opus Copyright 2001-2011 Xiph.Org, Skype Limited, Octasic, Jean-Marc Valin, Timothy B.

Availability. The SightCall Services will be available at least 99.95% of each month during the Term (\u201cAvailability\u201d), excluding \u201cScheduled Downtime\u201d and \u201cOther Causes\u201d (\u201cService Level Commitment\u201d). The SightCall Services are Available when Users are able to successfully perform remote assistance sessions as configured in their Tenant. 1.1. \u201cScheduled Downtime\u201d means the downtime resulting from either a Force Majeure event(s) or for regular maintenance, improvements and upgrades. 1.2. \u201cOther Causes \u201d means: (a) downtime caused solely by Customer and Users\u2019 use of the SightCall Services other than in accordance with the Agreement; (b) lack of Availability or untimely response time from Customer with regard to incidents that require Customer participation for source identification and/or resolution; (c) the impairment or unavailability of minor features or functionality that do not adversely affect the User experience or productivity such as cosmetic defects or pending requests for functionality or configuration changes not included in the core SightCall Services offering; (d) system impairment or unavailability caused by scheduled routine activities such as the loading of new data; and (e) Customer\u2019s or Users\u2019 computers or network equipment and any third party activities, equipment or software not within SightCall\u2019s direct control. 1.3. Customer may request monthly Availability information from SightCall by written request. 2. Scheduled and Unscheduled Maintenance. 2.1. Regularly scheduled maintenance time does not count as downtime. Maintenance time is considered regularly scheduled if it is communicated in accordance with Section 4 below at least forty-eight (48) hours in advance of the maintenance time. SightCall hereby provides notice that, on a weekly basis, Sunday between 01:00am and 07:00am UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) is reserved for routine scheduled maintenance for use as needed. 2.2. In emergency conditions, SightCall in its sole discretion may take the SightCall Services down for unscheduled maintenance and, in that event, will attempt to notify Customer in advance in accordance with the Section 4 below. Such unscheduled maintenance will not be counted against the Service Level Commitment. 3. Downtime Measured. The Service Level Commitment and Availability percentage is calculated by subtracting the \u201cTotal Minutes in a Calendar Month\u201d by the \u201cTotal Number of Downtime Minutes\u201d, divided by the \u201cTotal Minutes in a Calendar Month\u201d, multiplied by 100: \u201cAvailability\u201d as a percentage = [(Total Minutes in the Calendar Month \u2013 Downtime) \u2217 100] / (Total Minutes in the Calendar Month) Customer will notify SightCall of any downtime experience within forty-eight (48) hours of the incident, and Customer must obtain a \u201csupport ticket\u201d reference number in order to track Support Services results and to qualify for calculation against the Service Level Commitment hereunder. The measurement of record for availability of the SightCall Services shall be SightCall\u2019s system logs and other records. 4. Updates/Notice. Notice provided by SightCall will be sufficient if posted on the SightCall Support Services page located at http://support.sightcall.com/ or as delivered directly to Customer\u2019s contacts defined by Customer\u2019s Administrators, in a timely manner. 5. Remedies. If, in any calendar month during the Subscription Term, SightCall Services fall below the availability percentages listed below, and provided that Customer is not in material breach of this Agreement, then SightCall will grant Customer a credit for that month in the form of additional access to the SightCall Services at no additional cost at the end of the Subscription Term set forth in the Service Order based on the table set forth below (\u201cService Credits\u201d) solely for the additional period of time specified below. 6. Service Credit Table. In order to be eligible for the remedies set forth above in Section 5 above, Customer must open a Support ticket and request the Service Credit within thirty (30) days of the end of the month in which the SightCall Services fall below the availability defined below. Availability Service Credit 97.0 \u2013 99.94% 5 days 95.0 \u2013 96.9% 10 days 92.0 \u2013 94.9% 15 days 85.0 \u2013 91.9% 20 days 75.0 \u2013 84.9% 25 days 74.9% or less 30 days 7. Exclusion of Trial and Demo Accounts. SightCall trial, proof of value, evaluation and/or demo accounts and other test environments are expressly excluded from this Service Level Commitment or any other SightCall service level commitment.

We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information.

If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us at [email\u00a0protected]. \u200c CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES\u200c Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do- Not-Track (\u201cDNT\u201d) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice. \u200c DO UNITED STATES RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?\u200c In Short: If you are a resident of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah or Virginia, you are granted specific rights regarding access to your personal information.

HIPAA provides guidance for an acceptable level of protection for ePHI while giving healthcare providers access to information necessary to perform their daily business functions. There are many considerations that a healthcare provider, or other Covered Entity (as defined in HIPAA), must meet in order to satisfy HIPAA guidelines. SightCall has been designed such that healthcare providers and other Covered Entities may use our services for video communication in a manner that is consistent with their HIPAA obligations. We do not have access to identifiable health information, and we protect and encrypt all audio, video, and screen sharing data. How SightCall Supports HIPAA Compliance SightCall employs the following additional safeguards to help Covered Entities meet applicable HIPAA technical standards: Access Control HIPAA Standard Implement technical policies and procedures for electronic information systems that maintain electronic protected health information to allow access only to authorized persons or software programs. Unique User Identification: Assign a unique name and/or number for identifying and tracking user identity. Emergency Access Procedure: Establish (and implement as needed) procedures for obtaining necessary electronic health information during an emergency. Automatic Logoff: Implement electronic procedures that terminate an electronic session after a predetermined time of inactivity. How SightCall Supports the Standard One-to-one call data is secured using strong cryptographic protocols including Secured Real Time Protocol (SRTP) with AES-256 keys. The keys are dynamic and negotiated via DTLS for each call. Meeting data transmitted across the network is protected using the same mechanism for each participant. Multi-layered access control for staff, admin, and agents. Web and application access are protected by verified email address and password. Customers can also choose to use their own system and integrate through a SAML interface or ad-hoc SSO through integration with third party systems such as Salesforce, ServiceNow, Zendesk, etc. Meeting access is pin code protected, sent by SMS, email or customer specific integration. Meetings are not listed publicly. SightCall leverages a redundant and distributed architecture to offer a high level of availability and redundancy. In addition, SightCall performs daily backups of our data and can quickly assist the customer with data restoration and access to their data kept in SightCall\u2019s cloud. Note that none of the data are protected health information Meeting host can easily disconnect attendees or terminate sessions in progress. Delay for disconnection of an idle agent is fully configurable. Audit Controls HIPAA Standard Implement hardware, software, and/or procedural mechanisms that record and examine activity in information systems that contain or use electronic protected health information. How SightCall Supports the Standard Although SightCall does not store any protected Health Information, SightCall has implemented strong processes and mechanisms to control access to data. All controls are yearly audited by an external auditor in a SOC 2 process. Integrity HIPAA Standard Implement policies and procedures to protect electronic protected health information from improper alteration or destruction. How SightCall Supports the Standard Multilayer integration protection is designed to protect both data and service layers. Controls are in place to protect data in motion and at-rest. Integrity Mechanism HIPAA Standard Mechanism to authenticate electronic protected health information. Implemented methods to corroborate that information has not been destroyed of altered. How SightCall Supports the Standard Application executables are digitally signed. Web application communication is based on TLS with well-known certificate authorities. SRTP protocol prevent any changes or replay of previously created packets to ensure integrity of transmission. Person or Entity Authentication HIPAA Standard Verify that the person or entity seeking access is the one claimed. How SightCall Supports the Standard Agent access is verified either through SightCall login mechanism (verified email, password) or customer own SAML mechanisms. External user access is ensured through a pin code send by SMS or email and destroyed at the end of the call. Access to desktop or window for screen sharing is under the host\u2019s control. Transmission Security HIPAA Standard Protect electronic health information that is being transmitted over a network. Integrity controls: Ensure that protected health information is not improperly modified without detection. Encryption: Encrypt protected health information. How SightCall Supports the Standard No protected health information stored SightCall employs industry-standard Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption using 256-bit keys in SRTP Protocol to protect calls. Web Services are protected with industry standard TLS. Other Security and Privacy Compliance In addition to supporting healthcare organizations to be HIPAA compliant when using SightCall we also operate the SightCall platform with the following: SOC2 Type II GDPR CCPA Summary Compliance with all aspects of HIPAA is ultimately the responsibility of the Covered Entity. SightCall partners with our healthcare customers to help them implement our solutions in a manner that will assist Covered Entities in meeting their compliance obligations, including by applying industry standard encryption to the communications channels among endpoint clients and SightCall infrastructure. SightCall does not store or access Protected Health Information for a Covered Entity. These aspects, together with the power and flexibility of the SightCall platform, will allow healthcare customers to implement SightCall in a HIPAA-compliant manner.

This notice addresses SightCall\u2019s responsibilities as a business and as a service provider to you, whether you are a business or a consumer. Any terms we use in this notice that aren\u2019t defined here will have the meanings we give them in those agreements. Our Privacy Policy defines Customer Account Data, Customer Usage Data, and Customer Content. We\u2019ll refer to those here, too\u2026but mostly, we\u2019re talking about our customers\u2019 personal information. Personal information is defined in the California Consumer Privacy Act, or \u201cCCPA,\u201d and we use that definition. We will also talk about some other terms from the same law, such as \u201c consumer, \u201d \u201c business, \u201d \u201c service provider, \u201d \u201c business purpose,\u201d or \u201c commercial purpose,\u201d and those also have the definitions set out in that law.

SightCall\u2019s relationship with you under California law The SightCall Privacy Policy describes \u201ccontrollers\u201d and \u201cprocessors,\u201d and discusses the purposes for which we process personal information in Customer Account Data, Customer Usage Data, and Customer Content. For the purposes of the CCPA, in the same way that we act as a processor of Customer Content, we act as a service provider for Customer Content. For Customer Account Data and Customer Usage Data, we act as a business, which means that we may use this data for our own business purposes. Regardless of whether we are acting as a business or a service provider, we process, retain, use, and disclose personal information only as necessary to provide the services we have agreed to provide. In other words, we use the personal information we have strictly for business purposes. You can read more about our business purposes for each type of personal information in our Privacy Policy. Regardless, we will not: sell your personal information or your end users\u2019 personal information; process your personal information for any commercial purpose other than providing the services; or retain, use, or disclose your personal information outside of the scope of the agreement we have with you.

INTRODUCTION SightCall, Inc. and its affiliates (\u201cSightCall\u201d or \u201cwe\u201d) respects the privacy of our users (\u201cuser\u201d or \u201cyou\u201d). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our Service. Please read this privacy policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms of this privacy policy, please do not access the site. You are encouraged to periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed of updates. You will be deemed to have been made aware of, will be subject to, and will be deemed to have accepted the changes in any revised Privacy Policy by your continued use of our Service after the date such revised Privacy Policy is posted. SightCall processes two broad categories of personal information when you use our products and services: Your personal information as a customer (or potential customer) of SightCall\u2019s services \u2014 information that we refer to as Customer Account Data, and The personal information of your end users who use or interact with our applications or your application that you\u2019ve built on SightCall\u2019s platform, like the people you communicate by way of that application \u2014 this category contains both your Customer Usage Data (e.g., communications metadata) and your Customer Content (e.g., the contents of communications). SightCall processes these categories of personal information differently because the direct relationship we have with you, our customer, is different than the indirect relationship we have with your end users. CONTROLLER AND PROCESSOR Data protection laws and privacy laws in certain jurisdictions, like the European Economic Area (EEA), differentiate between \u201ccontrollers\u201d and \u201cprocessors\u201d of personal information. A controller decides why and how to process personal information. A processor processes personal information on behalf of a controller based on the controller\u2019s instructions. When SightCall processes your Customer Account Data, SightCall is acting as a controller. When SightCall processes Customer Content, we generally act as a processor. When we process Customer Usage Data, we act as a processor in many respects, but we may act as a controller in others. For example, we may need to use certain Customer Usage Data for the legitimate interests of billing, reconciling invoices with telecommunications carriers, and in the context of troubleshooting and detecting problems with the Service. HOW SIGHTCALL PROCESSES YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION We use Customer Account Data to further our legitimate interests to: understand who our customers and potential customers are and their interests in SightCall\u2019s product and services, manage our relationship with you and other customers, carry out core business operations such as accounting, filing taxes, and fulfilling regulatory obligations and help detect, prevent, or investigate security incidents, fraud and other abuse and/or misuse of our products and services.

We call this personal information Customer Account Data. We also collect Customer Usage Data from you when you send or receive communications through your use of our services.

This approach includes supporting our customers\u2019 compliance with EU data protection requirements, including those set out in the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which replaced the EU Data Protection Directive (also known as \u201cDirective 95/46/EC\u201c ) and became enforceable on May 25, 2018. If a company collects, transmits, hosts or analyzes personal data of EU citizens, GDPR requires the company to use third-party data processors who guarantee their ability to implement the technical and organizational requirements of the GDPR. To further earn our customers\u2019 trust, our DPA has been updated to provide our customers with contractual commitments regarding our compliance with applicable EU data protection law and to implement additional contractual provisions required by the GDPR. Our contractual commitments guarantee that customers can: Respond to requests from data subjects to correct, amend or delete personal data. Be made aware of and report personal data breaches to relevant supervisory authorities and data subjects in accordance with GDPR timeframes. Demonstrate their compliance with the GDPR as pertaining to SightCall\u2019s services. What is the GDPR? The General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) is the European privacy regulation which replaced the EU Data Protection Directive (\u201cDirective 95/46/EC\u201d). The GDPR addresses the processing of personal data and the free movement of such data. It aims to strengthen the security and protection of personal data in the EU and harmonize EU data protection law. Broadly, it sets out a number of data protection principles and requirements which must be adhered to when personal data is processed. The GDPR also established the European Data Protection Board (\u201cEPDB\u201d), which ensures that the data protection law is applied consistently across the EU and works to ensure effective cooperation amongst data protection authorities. How does the GDPR apply to customers? SightCall customers that collect and store personal data are considered data controllers under the GDPR. Data controllers bear the primary responsibility for ensuring that their processing of personal data is compliant with relevant EU data protection law, including the GDPR and uniquely determine what personal data is submitted to, and processed by, SightCall in accordance with the Services. What implications does GDPR have for organizations processing the personal data of EU citizens? One of the key aspects of the GDPR is that it creates consistency across EU member states on how personal data can be processed, used, and exchanged securely. Organizations need to demonstrate the security of the data they are processing and their compliance with GDPR on a continual basis, by implementing and regularly reviewing robust technical and organizational measures, as well as compliance policies. In its capacity as data processor, how does SightCall handle requests made by End-Users? If SightCall receives a data subject request from a Customer\u2019s End-User (i.e., a user of the Services to whom a Customer has provided our Services), SightCall is the Processor, and SightCall will, to the extent that applicable legislation does not prohibit SightCall from doing so, promptly inform the End-User to contact our Customer (i.e. the Controller) directly about any request relating to his/her Personal Data such as access or deletion. SightCall will not further respond to a data subject request without Customer\u2019s prior consent. What are some suggestions for SightCall customers with regard to GDPR? SightCall encourages customers to continually review their privacy and data security processes and policies to ensure compliance with the GDPR. Data controllers bear the primary responsibility for ensuring that their processing of personal data is compliant with EU data protection law. Below are some key points to consider for GDPR compliance: Geographical Application: The GDPR may apply to organizations that are established in the EU as well as certain organizations established outside the EU but which are processing the personal data of EU citizens, depending on their activities. Rights of End-Users: Organizations should be cognizant of End-Users whose personal data they may be processing. The GDPR establishes enhanced rights for End-Users, and organizations should be able to accommodate those rights. Data Breach Notifications: Organizations that are controllers of personal data should have clear processes in place in order to comply with the GDPR requirement to report data breaches in accordance with the time frames set out within the GDPR. SightCall will notify affected customers without undue delay if we become aware of a data breach of our services. Appointment of Data Protection Officer (\u201cDPO\u201d): Customers may need to appoint DPOs to manage issues relating to the processing of personal data. Data Processing Agreement (\u201cDPA\u201d): Where personal data is transferred outside the EEA, a customer may need DPAs in place with its sub-processors to ensure an adequate level of protection for the transferred data. Which SightCall services and features can support customers compliance with the GDPR? Customers can use SightCall\u2019s third-party SOC 2 audit reports to help conduct their risk assessments and determine whether appropriate technical and organizational measures are in place. Below are examples of specific SightCall product features that customers can utilize to assist with the GDPR compliance program. Auditing Standards: SOC 2 type 2 reports Scanning: Regular penetration test assessments Dynamic scanning of live applications Static scanning of code repositories Web Application Firewalls Encryption: Encryption of data in motion over public networks Encryption of certain data at rest with AES256 Does SightCall currently provide any product specific features or functionality in its products to assist us with our GDPR compliance program? Yes, more detailed information on how to use SightCall products to stay compliant with GDPR can be found via our Help Center or contacting your sales representative. What are the \u201cModel Clauses\u201d? The European Commission has approved a set of standard provisions called the Standard Contractual Clauses (\u201cModel Clauses\u201d) which provide a data controller a compliant mechanism to transfer personal data to a data processor outside the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d). The Model Clauses are appended to the SightCall DPA to help provide adequate protection for data transfer outside of the EEA or Switzerland. Does SightCall replicate the Service Data it stores? SightCall periodically replicates data for purposes of archival, backup and audit logs. We use Amazon Web Services (AWS) to store some of the information that is backed up, such as database information. Data are encrypted before external storage. What steps has SightCall taken to prepare for Brexit (the UK\u2019s departure from the European Union)? Irrespective of the outcome of the ongoing Brexit negotiations, SightCall remains committed to the success of our Customers and employees in the UK and the rest of Europe. We are closely monitoring the negotiations between the UK government and the European Union regarding the details of their future relationship. As the details become clear, we will take appropriate measures to ensure that our Customers can continue to use our services in compliance with both EU and UK laws, and for SightCall overall, business will continue as usual and will remain focused on our Customers\u2019 success.

Customer acknowledges that a new Service Order is not required for an automatic renewal that occurs under Section 8.1. SightCall Services pricing terms and descriptions as of the Effective Date are as set forth in a separate Services Order subject to and governed by this Agreement. SightCall reserves the right to increase fees applicable to SightCall Services (as well as for additional Users, session recording functionality, multi-party session capabilities and other fees for new modules and features) by providing Customer thirty (30) days\u2019 notice prior to the end of each active Subscription Term. 5.2 Payments Terms. SightCall Service fees are invoiced annually in advance. Except as otherwise set forth in a SOW, Professional Services fees are invoiced in advance and on a time and materials basis. Customer will pay each invoice within 30 days following the invoice date. Late payments will accrue interest at a rate of 1.5% per month or the legal maximum rate, whichever is lower. Customer will cure a delinquency in payment of any amounts owed under this Agreement within 30 days from the date of SightCall\u2019s delinquency notice. If Customer fails to timely cure such delinquency, or regain compliance under Section 8.2 (defining the cure period for breach), SightCall may suspend Customer\u2019s use of the SightCall Services or terminate this Agreement for breach, in addition to any other available rights and remedies. Customer is responsible for all fees, expenses and other costs relating to or connected with making invoiced payments to SightCall under this Agreement, including the direct payment of all banking fees, ACH processing fees, currency conversions, or similar transactional costs and fees; none of which Customer may deducted or off-set from the SightCall\u2019s invoiced total fee. All terms of this Section 5 shall apply unless expressly stated otherwise in the applicable Service Order, SOW, or the Documentation. 5.3 Taxes. SightCall Services fees do not include any taxes, levies, duties or similar governmental assessments of any nature, including for example, value-added sales, use or withholding taxes, assessable by any jurisdiction whatsoever (collectively, \u201cTaxes\u201d). Customer is responsible for paying all Taxes associated with Customer purchases hereunder. If SightCall has the legal obligation to pay or collect Taxes for which Customer are responsible under this Section 5.3, SightCall will invoice Customer and Customer will pay that amount unless Customer provides SightCall with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority. For the avoidance of doubt, SightCall shall be solely responsible for Taxes assessable against SightCall based on SightCall\u2019s income, property and employees, and Customer shall not withhold or deduct any amounts for same except as required by applicable law. Should Customer be required under any law or regulation of any governmental entity or authority outside of the United States, to withhold or deduct any portion of the payments due to SightCall, then Customer shall increase the sum payable to SightCall by the amount necessary to yield to SightCall an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no withholdings or deductions been made. 5.4 No Set-Off. Customer will not set-off or offset against SightCall\u2019s invoices amounts that Customer claims are due to Customer by SightCall, or any amounts resulting from any billing or collection disputes. Customer will bring any claims or causes of action Customer may have in a separate action and waive any rights Customer may have to offset, set-off, or withhold payment for the SightCall Services delivered by SightCall. 5.5 Voice And Data Charges; Customer Connectivity. Customer is responsible for all fees and charges imposed by Customer\u2019s telephone carriers, wireless providers, and other voice and/or data transmission providers for voice and/or data transmission used to access and use the SightCall Services. If Customer\u2019s broadband connection and/or telephone service fails, or Customer experiences a power failure, the SightCall Services may also cease to function due to reasons outside of SightCall control, and SightCall shall not be liable for, and Customer expressly releases SightCall from any liability, in connection with such events or activities. 5.6 Use Verification. SightCall may remotely review the scope of Customer\u2019s use of the SightCall Service, and on SightCall\u2019s written request, Customer will provide reasonable assistance to verify Customer\u2019s compliance with the Agreement with respect to access to and use of the SightCall Services. If SightCall determines that Customer has exceeded its permitted access and use rights to the SightCall Service as described in a Service Order, SightCall will notify Customer and Customer will, within 30 days, either: (1) disable any unpermitted use; or (2) purchase additional use and access rights commensurate with Customer\u2019s actual use, at SightCall\u2019s then effective rates and fees. 6. Confidential Information. 6.1 Confidential Information Defined. As used herein, \u201cConfidential Information\u201d means non-public information that the party disclosing the information designates at the time of disclosure as being confidential, or, if disclosed orally or visually, is identified as such prior to disclosure, or which, under the circumstances surrounding the disclosure, the receiving party knows or has reason to know should be treated as confidential without the need to be marked as such. Without limiting the foregoing, Confidential Information shall include any information regarding a party\u2019s financial condition, business opportunities, plans for development of future products, unreleased versions of products, know-how, technology, customer information, and customer data. SightCall Technology, SightCall Services and Documentation shall be deemed SightCall Confidential Information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing received by a receiving party shall be construed as Confidential Information which: (i) is or becomes generally available to the public without breach of this Agreement; (ii) is lawfully obtained from a third party without a duty of confidentiality; (iii) is known to the receiving party prior to such disclosure; or (iv) is, at any time, developed by the receiving party independent of any such disclosure(s) from the disclosing party and the receiving party can reasonably show such independence. 6.2 Non-Disclosure. The receiving party shall not disclose the disclosing party\u2019s Confidential Information to any third party and may only use the disclosing party\u2019s Confidential Information for the intended business purpose related to this Agreement and for the benefit of the disclosing party. Both parties shall protect Confidential Information from disclosure or misuse by using the same degree of care as for their own confidential information of like importance, but shall at least use reasonable care. Further, both parties agree to have each of their employees or independent contractors with access to any Confidential Information agree to be bound by an enforceable agreement that ensures the protection of the Confidential Information from disclosure to at least the same extent as does this Agreement. Each receiving party agrees to promptly notify the disclosing party upon learning of any unauthorized disclosure of the disclosing party\u2019s Confidential Information, and shall provide reasonable assistance to the disclosing party to remedy and contain such breach. In connection therewith, Customer agrees to provide any such notice to SightCall at [email\u00a0protected]. The foregoing notwithstanding, a receiving party may disclose the other party\u2019s Confidential Information if the information is required by law to be disclosed in response to a valid order of a court of competent jurisdiction or authorized government agency, provided that the receiving party must give the disclosing party prompt written notice, if legally permitted, and obtain or allow for a reasonable effort by the disclosing party to obtain a protective order prior to disclosure, at this disclosing party\u2019s cost and expense. 6.3 Equitable Remedies. The parties agree that a breach of the confidentiality obligations set forth in this Agreement by receiving party may cause immediate and irreparable damage to disclosing party and shall entitle disclosing party, without the necessity of posting a bond, to seek injunctive relief to prevent the continued unauthorized use of disclosing party\u2019s Confidential Information, as well as to pursue all other remedies available to disclosing party at law. 7. Representations and Warranties. 7.1 Limited SightCall Services Warranty. SightCall warrants, for Customer\u2019s benefit only, that the SightCall Services will operate in substantial conformity with the applicable Documentation. SightCall\u2019s sole liability (and Customer\u2019s sole and exclusive remedy) for any breach of this warranty shall be, at no charge to Customer, for SightCall to use commercially reasonable efforts to correct the reported non-conformity, or if SightCall is unable to correct the defect SightCall Services, or if SightCall determines such remedy is impracticable, either party may then terminate the applicable SightCall Services following a cure period of not less than thirty (30) days. The limited warranty set forth in this Section 7.1 shall not apply: (i) unless Customer makes a claim within thirty (30) days of the date on which Customer first noticed the non-conformity, (ii) if the error was caused by misuse, unauthorized modifications or third-party hardware, software or services, or (iii) to use provided on a no-charge or evaluation basis. 7.2 Limited Support and Professional Services Warranty. In addition, SightCall shall perform Support Service and Professional Services in a competent, professional and workmanlike manner consistent with applicable industry practices. Provided Customer provides timely written notice of non-conforming Support or Professional Services performance within thirty (30) days following the completion of each Support or Professional Service, SightCall will timely re-perform the applicable Service in accordance with the foregoing warranty, and if SightCall is unable or incapable of performing the Support Service within thirty (30) days following the warranty claim, Customer may terminate the Subscription Term, and shall receive as its sole remedy, a refund of any fees Customer has pre-paid for use of the SightCall Service for the terminated portion of the applicable Subscription Term. If SightCall is unable or incapable of reperforming the Professional Service within thirty (30) days following the warranty claim, Customer may terminate the SOW, and receive a refund for that portion of the Professional Services that is defective. 7.3 Warranty Disclaimer. (A) EXCEPT FOR THE LIMITED WARRANTIES IN SECTIONS 7.1 and 7.2, ABOVE, THE SIGHTCALL SERVICES ARE PROVIDED \u201cAS IS\u201d. NEITHER SIGHTCALL NOR ITS PARTNERS AND SUPPLIERS MAKE ANY OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NONINFRINGEMENT. SIGHTCALL DOES NOT WARRANT THAT CUSTOMER\u2019S USE OF THE SIGHTCALL SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, NOR DOES SIGHTCALL WARRANT THAT IT WILL REVIEW THE CUSTOMER MATERIALS FOR ACCURACY OR THAT IT WILL PRESERVE OR MAINTAIN THE CUSTOMER MATERIALS WITHOUT LOSS. SIGHTCALL SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR DELAYS, INTERRUPTIONS, SERVICE FAILURES OR OTHER PROBLEMS INHERENT IN USE OF THE INTERNET AND ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS OR OTHER SYSTEMS OUTSIDE THE REASONABLE CONTROL OF SIGHTCALL. CUSTOMER MAY HAVE OTHER STATUTORY RIGHTS, BUT THE DURATION OF STATUTORILY REQUIRED WARRANTIES, IF ANY, SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE SHORTEST PERIOD PERMITTED BY LAW. (B) SIGHTCALL HAS NO LIABILITY OR RESPONSIBILITY, AND CUSTOMER IS SOLELY RESPONSIBLE, FOR ASSESSING WHETHER THE SIGHTCALL SERVICES (INCLUDING SIGHTCALL\u2019S SECURITY OBLIGATIONS) WILL MEET CUSTOMER\u2019S REGULATORY OR OTHER LEGAL OBLIGATIONS. SIGHTCALL DOES NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT THE SIGHTCALL SERVICES WILL ACHIEVE CUSTOMER\u2019S DESIRED RESULTS AND SIGHTCALL DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY OF ANY KIND FOR DECISIONS MADE BASED ON USE OR OTHER RESULTS OF THE SIGHTCALL SERVICE. SIGHTCALL HAS NO CONTROL OVER, AND WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY FOR, ANY ACTS OR OMISSIONS OF ANY USERS. (C) CUSTOMER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT SIGHTCALL SERVICES ARE NOT DESIGNED OR INTENDED FOR ACCESS AND/OR USE IN OR DURING HIGH-RISK ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO: MEDICAL PROCEDURES; ON-LINE CONTROL OF AIRCRAFT, AIR TRAFFIC, AIRCRAFT NAVIGATION OR AIRCRAFT COMMUNICATIONS, OR THE DESIGN, CONSTRUCTION, OPERATION OR MAINTENANCE OF ANY NUCLEAR FACILITY. CUSTOMER UNDERSTANDS THAT THE SIGHTCALL SERVICES DO NOT ALLOW AND SHOULD NOT BE USED FOR CALLS TO EMERGENCY SERVICES NUMBERS (E.G., IN THE UNITED STATES 911, OR IN THE UNITED KINGDOM 999 AND 112). WITHOUT LIMITING ANY OTHER DISCLAIMERS SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, SIGHTCALL EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR SUCH PURPOSES. 7.4 By Customer. Customer represents and warrants that the Customer has the right and authority to enter into this Agreement, to perform its duties and obligations hereunder, exercise its rights hereunder, and to grant the licenses granted by Customer under this Agreement. Customer further represents and warrants that Customer has secured for SightCall all right, license, permission and consent necessary to access and use Customer Materials, Users\u2019 account information and any data Users upload to the SightCall Services platform for the purposes of delivering the SightCall Services, responding to any technical problems, troubleshooting and testing, and that Customer Materials do not and will not infringe on any privacy, intellectual property or other rights of third parties. Customer represents and warrants that Customer\u2019s use of the SightCall Services shall comply with all applicable laws, regulations, statutes, judicial decisions or other rules and regulatory or governmental rulings in connection with Customer\u2019s business operations. Customer shall be solely liable to SightCall or to third parties, for any violation, breach or non-compliance with any of the foregoing obligations. 8. Term and Termination. 8.1 Term. The term of this Agreement (\u201cTerm\u201d) and the SightCall Services period set forth in the initial Service Order (the \u201cSubscription Term\u201d) shall commence on the Effective Date hereof, and shall continue until the termination of this Agreement in accordance with the terms hereof and for the duration set forth in the Service Order. The Agreement and the SightCall Services set forth in a Service Order will automatically renew for additional, consecutive one (1) year periods (each a \u201cRenewal Term\u201d), unless either Party provides not less than thirty (30) days\u2019 written notice of non-renewal prior to the end of the applicable Subscription or Renewal Term. 8.2 Termination. Either party may terminate this Agreement (including all related Service Orders) if the other party (a) fails to cure any material breach of this Agreement (including a failure to pay fees) within thirty (30) days after written notice; (b) ceases operations without a successor; or (c) seeks protection under any bankruptcy, receivership, trust deed, creditors\u2019 arrangement, composition, or comparable proceeding, or if any such proceeding is instituted against that party (and not dismissed within sixty (60) days thereafter). 8.3 Effect of Termination. Upon any expiration or termination of this Agreement, Customer shall immediately cease any and all use of and access to the SightCall Services (including any and all related SightCall Technology) and delete (or, at SightCall\u2019s request, return) any and all copies of the Documentation, any SightCall passwords or access codes and any other SightCall Confidential Information in its possession. SightCall shall make Customer Materials available for retrieval for thirty (30) days following termination of this Agreement for any reason. Thereafter, Customer acknowledges that following termination (and the Customer Materials retrieval period), it shall have no further access to the SightCall Services or any Customer Materials submitted to the SightCall Service, and that SightCall may delete any such materials as may have been stored by SightCall at any time. Except where an exclusive remedy is specified, the exercise of either party of any remedy under this Agreement, including termination, will be without prejudice to any other remedies it may have under this Agreement, by law or otherwise. 8.4 Survival. All terms of this Agreement which by their nature extend beyond the termination of this Agreement, remain in effect until fulfilled and apply to respective successors and assigns. 9. Indemnification. 9.1 SightCall Indemnification. SightCall shall defend Customer from and against any claim by a third party alleging the SightCall Service when used as authorized under this Agreement, infringes a patent, copyright, or trademark and shall indemnify and hold Customer harmless from and against any damages and costs awarded against Customer or agreed in settlement by SightCall (including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees) resulting from such claim, provided that SightCall shall have received from Customer: (i) prompt written notice of such claim (but in any event notice in sufficient time for SightCall to respond without prejudice); (ii) the exclusive right to control and direct the investigation, defense and settlement (if applicable) of such claim; and (iii) all reasonable necessary cooperation of Customer. If Customer\u2019s use of the SightCall Services is (or in SightCall\u2019s opinion is likely to be) enjoined, if required by settlement or if SightCall determines such actions are reasonably necessary to avoid material liability, SightCall may, in its sole discretion: (a) substitute substantially functionally similar products or services; (b) procure for Customer the right to continue using the SightCall Service; or if (a) and (b) are not commercially reasonable, (c) terminate the Agreement and refund to Customer any fees Customer has pre-paid for use of the SightCall Service for the terminated portion of the applicable Subscription Term. The foregoing indemnification obligation of SightCall shall not apply: (1) if the SightCall Services are modified by any party other than SightCall, but solely to the extent the alleged infringement is caused by such modification; (2) if the SightCall Services are combined with platforms, data, products or processes not provided by SightCall, but solely to the extent the alleged infringement is caused by such combination; (3) to any unauthorized use of the SightCall Services; (4) to any action arising as a result of Customer Materials, or any other third-party applications, data or components contained within the SightCall Services; (5) to the extent the alleged infringement is not caused by the particular technology or implementation of the SightCall Services but instead by features common to any similar product or service; or (6) if Customer settles or makes any admissions with respect to a claim without SightCall\u2019s prior written consent. THIS SECTION 9.1 SETS FORTH SIGHTCALL\u2019S AND ITS PARTNERS AND SUPPLIERS\u2019 SOLE LIABILITY AND CUSTOMER\u2019S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIM OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT. 9.2 Indemnification by Customer. Customer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless SightCall from and against any and all claims, costs, damages, losses, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and costs) arising out of or in connection with any claim arising from or relating to (a) any Customer Materials or breach or alleged breach by Customer of Section 3 (Customer Obligations), (b) any service or product offered by Customer in connection with or related to the SightCall Services or (c) sharing of Customer Materials with (or use thereof by) third-party Users. This indemnification obligation is subject to Customer receiving (i) prompt written notice of such claim from SightCall (but in any event notice in sufficient time for Customer to respond without prejudice); (ii) the exclusive right to control and direct the investigation, defense, or settlement of such claim; and (iii) all necessary cooperation from SightCall at Customer\u2019s expense. 10. Limitation Of Liability. 10.1 Consequential Damages Waiver. EXCEPT FOR EXCLUDED CLAIMS (DEFINED BELOW), NEITHER PARTY (NOR ITS PARTNERS OR SUPPLIERS) SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT FOR ANY LOSS OF USE, LOST DATA, LOST PROFITS, FAILURE OF SECURITY MECHANISMS, INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, OR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, RELIANCE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, EVEN IF INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES IN ADVANCE. 10.2 Liability Cap. EXCEPT FOR EXCLUDED CLAIMS, NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT, EACH PARTY AND ITS PARTNERS AND SUPPLIERS\u2019 ENTIRE LIABILITY TO THE OTHER PARTY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT PAID OR PAYABLE BY CUSTOMER TO SIGHTCALL DURING TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE LIABILITY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. 10.3 Excluded Claims. \u201cExcluded Claims\u201d means any claim arising (a) from Customer\u2019s breach of Section 2.6 (General Restrictions); (b) under Section 3 (Customer Obligations); (c) from a party\u2019s breach of its obligations in Section 6 (Confidential Information) (but excluding claims related to Customer Materials); or (d) a party\u2019s indemnification obligations under Section 9 of this Agreement. 10.4 Nature of Claims and Failure of Essential Purpose. The parties agree that the waivers and limitations specified in this Section 10 apply regardless of the form of action, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability or otherwise and will survive and apply even if any limited remedy specified in this Agreement is found to have failed of its essential purpose. 11. Ownership. 11.1 Rights in Customer Materials. As between the parties, Customer shall retain all right, title and interest (including any and all intellectual property rights) in and to the Customer Materials as provided to SightCall. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Customer hereby grants to SightCall a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free right to use, copy, store, transmit and publicly perform and display the Customer Materials solely to the extent necessary to provide the SightCall Service to or as directed by Customer. 11.2 SightCall Technology.

Customer acknowledges that it is obtaining only a limited right to the SightCall Services and that irrespective of any use of the words \u201cpurchase\u201d, \u201csale\u201d or like terms in this Agreement no ownership rights are being conveyed to Customer under this Agreement. Customer agrees that SightCall or its suppliers retain all right, title and interest (including all patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property rights) in and to all of the SightCall Services, Support Services, Documentation, Professional Services deliverables (but excluding any Customer Materials incorporated therein) and any and all related and underlying technology and documentation, and any derivative works, modifications or improvements of any of the foregoing, including as may incorporate Feedback (collectively, \u201cSightCall Technology\u201d). Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, no rights in any SightCall Technology are granted to Customer. Further, Customer acknowledges that the SightCall Services is an online, hosted solution, and that except for Client Software, Customer has no right to obtain a copy of the SightCall Services. SightCall reserves all rights in and to SightCall Technology not expressly granted to Customer hereunder. 11.3 Feedback. Customer, from time to time, may submit comments, questions, suggestions or other feedback relating to any SightCall product or service to SightCall (\u201cFeedback\u201d). SightCall may freely use and exploit Feedback in connection with any of its products or services without any obligation to notify, account for, or compensate Customer. 11.4 Service Data. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Customer agrees that SightCall may obtain technical and other data about Customer\u2019s use of the SightCall Services (\u201cService Data\u201d), and SightCall may use and share the Service Data to improve, support, develop, provide and deliver reporting regarding the SightCall Service during and after the Term of this Agreement, provided that when sharing the Service Data outside of SightCall\u2019s internal business operations, SightCall does not identify Customer as the source of such Service Data without Customer\u2019s prior written permission. 12. Miscellaneous. 12.1 No Agency. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to create any agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment relationship.

Neither party may assign this Agreement without the advance written consent of the other party, except that either party may assign this Agreement in connection with a merger, reorganization, acquisition or other transfer of all or substantially all of such party\u2019s assets or voting securities.

Notices shall be deemed given when delivered by registered post or courier, with return receipt or acknowledgment requested. 12.4 Force Majeure. Neither party shall be liable to the other for any delay or failure to perform any obligation under this Agreement (except for a failure to pay fees) if the delay or failure is due to unforeseen events that occur after the signing of this Agreement and that are beyond the reasonable control of such party, such as a strike, blockade, war, act of terrorism, riot, natural disaster, failure or diminishment of power or telecommunications or data networks or services, or refusal of a license by a government agency. 12.5 Export Compliance. In its use of the SightCall Services, Customer agrees to comply with all export and import laws and regulations of the United States, the European Union and other applicable jurisdictions. Without limiting the foregoing, (i) Customer represents and warrants that it is not listed on any U.S. government list of prohibited or restricted parties or located in (or a national of) a country that is subject to a U.S. government embargo or that has been designated by the U.S. government as a \u201cterrorist supporting\u201d country, (ii) Customer shall not (and shall not permit any of its Users to) access or use the SightCall Services in violation of any U.S. export embargo, prohibition or restriction, and (iii) Customer shall not submit to the SightCall Services any information that is controlled under the U.S. International Traffic in Arms Regulations. 12.6 Government End-Users.

Customer shall not cause SightCall to violate the FCPA, the UK Bribery Act or any Anti-Corruption Laws in connection with the activities conducted on behalf of SightCall under the Agreement or any other activities involving SightCall (collectively, the \u201cActivities\u201d). Customer shall not, in connection with the Activities, pay, offer, promise, or authorize the payment or transfer of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any other person or entity for the purpose of improperly obtaining or retaining business, for any other advantage for SightCall, or for any other purpose prohibited by the FCPA, UK Bribery Act or any Anti-Corruption Laws. 12.8 Publicity.

Customer also agrees to participate in other reasonable marketing activities that promote the benefits of the SightCall Services to other potential customers and to use the Customer\u2019s name and logo on SightCall web site and in SightCall promotional materials. This consent terminates upon termination of this Agreement. 12.9 Foreign Language Translation.

The Parties agree that any dispute arising under this Agreement shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts of San Francisco County, California, and the parties agree not to bring an action in any other venue.

The United Nations Convention for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to this Agreement.

This Agreement, including all Schedules to this Agreement, sets forth the entire agreement and understanding of the parties relating to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements, proposals, negotiations, conversations, discussions and understandings, written or oral, with respect to such subject matter and all past dealing or industry custom. In the event of any conflict between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions of any schedule, the terms and conditions of this Agreement will govern.

Any changes or amendments to this Agreement must be in writing, expressly refer to the changes to this Agreement, and be duly executed by both parties. 12.13 Waiver of Breach. No delay or omission by either party to exercise any right or power arising upon the other party\u2019s nonperformance or breach will impair that right or power or be construed as a waiver of it. Any waiver must be in writing and signed by the waiving party. A waiver on one occasion will not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent event of nonperformance or breach. 12.14 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy, all other provisions of this Agreement will nonetheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic and legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not affected in any manner adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any provision is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced, the Parties will negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled. 12.15 Counterparts.

Get a Demo One image is worth a thousand words. That\u2019s the sentence I used to build SightCall. We bring vision to the service process, making complex issues easier to solve. \u2014Thomas Cottereau, SightCall CEO Our Story In 2008, Thomas Cottereau and Antoine Vervoort discovered a gap in the way businesses provided support. They saw an opportunity to use live video for more than just face-to-face interactions. They envisioned a solution that could bridge the space between the digital and physical world. What began as a bootstrapped project in a friend\u2019s basement quickly evolved into a pioneering software solution that seamlessly integrates live visual assistance into customer service and field operations. When the pandemic hit in 2020, SightCall helped international brands pivot quickly to remotely serve customers during the crisis. And in the years that followed, we stayed and helped them leverage remote visual support to boost productivity, customer loyalty and operational efficiency. Today, SightCall stands as a global leader in visual support, with hundreds of enterprise customers worldwide. But SightCall\u2019s mission goes beyond helping teams see, show and solve. We\u2019re focused on a future where smart visual technology saves more time, uses less energy, requires fewer resources and empowers companies to deliver truly remarkable service.

Founded in Italy in 1879, the company delivers and optimizes after-sales insurance services that lengthen the value chain, while providing a personalized approach to claim management. With more than a century of experience, the company has grown to over 300 employees in 18 offices across Europe. Internationally, it became a member of the respected Sedgwick Alliance of insurance providers in June 2020. As a frontrunner in in harnessing insurtech to maximize operational efficiency and improve policyholder satisfaction, Lecari Group sought a new way to support its customers in underwriting and risk transfer, as well as in the management of after-sales service, crisis situations, and emerging risks. The Challenge For much of its history, Lercari Group loss adjusters traveled to visit customers in person to file claims, a process that extended the life cycle of a claim from days to weeks and strained company resources during busy cycles. Lengthy claims resolution times, much of it attributable to this required travel and facetime involved, made it difficult for Lercari Group to optimize customer experiences and control costs. \u201cThe insurance industry is constantly evolving its digital landscape, even more so now,\u201d managing director Giovanni Lercari said. The company sought an enterprise-level solution that would reduce travel, improve adjusters\u2019 efficiency, and pave the way for future digital innovations in claims management. The solution also needed to facilitate a frictionless customer experience that would not compromise its reputation for loss assessments of excellence. The need to accelerate the desired transition toward virtual claim inspections was made all the more urgent with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. When Italy quickly became Europe\u2019s hardest-hit country, social distancing measures made in-person visits impossible, requiring Lercari Group to quickly scale-up its digital solutions. The Solution For several years, Lercari Group has used SightCall to deliver its Video Perizia service to national and international clients, with extraordinary results. The company was attracted to SightCall\u2019s seamless integration capabilities and rapid setup time. Dozens of Lecari Group\u2019s experts, each with at least three years of feild experience were able to access the platform within days. Using SightCall, Lecari Group was able to respond to requests within twelve hours from the time they received a claim. Utilizing tools such as an interactive interface with augmented reality capabilities, allows them to point, screen-share, and annotate, as well as leverage security features such as geolocation to confirm the exact GPS coordinates of a claim. Adjusters can collect clear images useful for detailed assessments with a high degree of accuracy. The stability of the connection allows them to maintain open communication with the insured. With benefits like Smart Optical Character Recognition, experts are also able to collect and read data from a smartphone and instantly feed it back to the claim file, eliminating error-prone manual entry and easing data-sharing between all participants. Benefits From the launch of Video Perizia with SightCall, Lercari Group\u2019s customer satisfaction rates and net promoter scores (NPS) have soared. Insureds describing a favorable claims experience has increased from the mid-80s to over 90% since 2018. Travel distances for adjusters decreased from more than 500 kilometers a week to around 250, resulting in significant cost savings for Lercari. Now, in-person site visits are reserved only for the most complicated claims. SightCall\u2019s full compliance with data regulations like the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) eliminates the need for different platforms in multiple countries. Consistent, safe handling of sensitive data provided peace of mind for all parties in the claims process. The client\u2019s expert consultants found they were able to dramatically scale up remote assistance whenever needed. With the unpredictability of COVID-19 came a need for complete reliance on virtual claims assistance. Even with a large surge of video call volume, there were no issues with bandwidth capabilities. Continued claims management, now near 100% digital, was possible with minimal-to-no disruption to company operations and quality assurance. Managing director Giovanni Lercari observed, \u201cOur adoption of video expertise and its integration with SightCall has allowed us to have total mastery and knowledge, generating a series of benefits for the supply chain and for our Group, even in a time of global emergency.\u201d Among those benefits included the ability to operate without geographical limits and in total safety throughout the territory covered by the company. \u201cIn the context of COVID-19, SightCall kept our supply chain from being interrupted,\u201d added TPA project manager Magdalena Szwalbe. \u201cThe most important benefit for us is related to insurance companies, who are our first clients. Without SightCall, it wouldn\u2019t be possible to provide services to insurers, who in turn couldn\u2019t provide services to their claimants/clients in order to finalize claim proceedings.\u201d Get Connected!

In recent years, MacDermid Graphics Solutions has been focused on applying remote solutions to further improve several key performance indicators (KPIs) on equipment maintenance, in order to bolster customer satisfaction and shorten resolution times. The Challenge As with many companies, MacDermid Graphics Solutions\u2019 interest in virtual support tools increased at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. With service technicians\u2019 ability to fulfill maintenance and repair work orders on-site significantly decreased, MacDermid Graphics Solutions had to balance keeping its people safe while maintaining its hard-won reputation for customer care. The company immediately began a search for virtual tools that worked effortlessly within its existing Salesforce CRM, could be quickly adopted internally and had maximum accessibility for customers and field technicians, many of whom were inexperienced with using advanced technology. It was essential to find a solution that would work on mobile devices, but also enabled its people to use hands-free gadgets such as smart glasses. A primary objective was to permit technicians to be remotely guided through a task or repair process with the benefit of augmented reality (AR) overlay, while still having both hands able to maneuver. In the long-term, MacDermid Graphics Solutions was eager to tackle extended turnaround times for maintenance or repair work orders, convinced that with the right virtual support tool, needing several days to fix a printer issue and get a machine back up and running would be a thing of the past. Response time was of high importance for the company, enabling its technical support team to deal with issues as if they were there, in front of the equipment. The Solution MacDermid Graphics Solutions adopted SightCall, attracted to its seamless interface within the company\u2019s existing Salesforce CRM. SightCall proved to be a one-stop-shop for its visual assistance, with both the ability to conduct the calls and essential communications data from them gathered in the same system. This enables the company to maintain a more efficient workflow. Customers and technicians can launch SightCall video sessions through their own smartphones, providing and receiving crucial work order information in real-time thanks to Salesforce integration. Regardless of where the work order is and dependability of local wireless or mobile data connectivity, sessions benefit from guaranteed HD picture quality and reliable video, with SightCall optimized for low-bandwidth conditions. Tools like Smart Optical Character Recognition can accurately read and interpret data on a machine, even from a distance of several feet, and feed it directly back to the work order, with no manual data entry required. When MacDermid Graphics Solutions technicians have no other choice but to go on-site, they can have their hands free to do the work using smart glasses, while a remote expert walks them through it. SightCall\u2019s AR overlay includes remote measurement and annotation tools that allow for precise identification and dimensions of parts, ensuring the most accurate maintenance processes. Because of these features, only a single service technician needs to be dispatched to handle more complicated cases, preserving manpower and respecting pandemic-related social distancing requirements. The training of junior or less experienced technicians has also been augmented by the immersive experience provided by the platform. \u201cWe are continuously looking to improve and implement valuable tools for our technical service and support. SightCall not only provides the features we desire, but also seamlessly integrates into our Salesforce ecosystem. We are excited to provide the value-add of interactive, live video assistance and diagnostics to our customers,\u201d said Nancy Barto, Director, Global Customer Relations at MacDermid Graphics Solutions. High compatibility with data protection regulation, such as GDPR and CCPA, means MacDermid Graphics Solutions can use SightCall as its sole remote support solution for its customers anywhere in the world. After only a few months of deploying SightCall, MacDermid Graphics Solutions realized a 20% truck roll reduction in the number of work orders that required sending a technician on-site. Customers were guided through issues with their printers with the help of a remote expert, increasing first-time fix rates and improving the customer experience. When service technicians are dispatched to the site, they can take photos of printer parts, identify them in the Salesforce database with 100% accuracy and feed the information directly back to the parts department. The use of SightCall for parts replacement has cut work order completion down from days to hours. \u201cThe timing was perfect, because of the pandemic. But now that we have SightCall, I wonder how we ever did it without this before,\u201d said MacDermid Graphics Solutions Equipment Service Manager, Nick Casaletto. Get Connected! See It. Show It.

Their 38,000 employees support a portfolio of both iconic and emerging brands available in more than 40 countries. Their vision to create an agile and customer-driven culture has empowered their digital transformation, even as the COVID-19 crisis accelerated their needs for remote solutions. Challenge The safety of food practices in compliance with precise regulations and standards is integral to the global food system and human health. While the principles of food safety are straightforward, verification of them involves a complex system of inspections and audits at every level. These inspections are crucial for Kraft Heinz to ensure quality assurance, identify and coordinate improvements, and resolve issues related to customer complaints. Ensuring the safety of their essential workers during the COVID-19 crisis was paramount. With travel restrictions in place both internationally and between states, Kraft Heinz needed a way to empower their specialists to continue maintaining the high standards of food safety for consumers without disrupting a supply chain built on a wide network of suppliers, copackers, and warehouses. Kraft Heinz quickly began searching for a remote virtual support system robust enough to be implemented in a variety of very specific use cases and allow for the standardization of both routine and incident-related audits. Security of information was paramount, as was the need to be able to share and store documents within a single platform. Consistent video quality was also a priority, with some facilities in areas that might have low bandwidth, such as storage warehouses. Solution To help Kraft Heinz immediately address the essential safety of their employees as well as consumers around the world, SightCall deployed their visual assistance platform within weeks. Kraft Heinz was able to quickly fold it into their processes for auditing, inspections, document review, and factory tours that had previously only been conducted face-to-face. Kraft Heinz leveraged SightCall for every step of their visits to their partners including suppliers, copackers, factories, and warehouses. Before the inspection starts, they use the platform to share relevant documents, arrange the logistics, and explain how someone on-site can join the SightCall session. During the inspection, remote agents can guide the entire process. The expert remote auditors at Kraft Heinz use features like flashlight control to get better visibility in dim light and AR annotations to illustrate recommendations or identify potential problems. With the ability to capture and save photos from live video they can store visual records of equipment and processes alongside the inspection or audit documents. SightCall is also used for multidisciplinary calls that can bring several people into one SightCall session. This enables the remote auditors to have additional experts to offer specialized advice before and during the inspections and document reviews. The chat feature allows these participants to interact during the live SightCall session to offer suggestions both to the remote auditor and the on-site contact. Benefits The flexibility to use any device partnered with strong security and compliance allowed the client to implement remote visual support quickly across multiple use cases at any of their partners\u2019 facilities. Since deploying SightCall, Kraft Heinz has found that not only are they able to reduce travel time, but their processes are much more efficient. Previously, visits such as factory tours and inspections could take up to three days and sometimes required multiple visits. This was due in part to the need to review relevant documents and certifications while on-site, something that can now be done via SightCall in advance. With less travel, simple coordination, quicker resolution times, and the ease of storing related documentation, the number of inspections and audits conducted has skyrocketed. Although the client was expecting the benefits of reduced travel, including reducing their carbon footprint, the ease of arranging the logistics of a remote inspection with SightCall has proven to be even more beneficial. Employee and partner feedback has been incredibly positive: \u201cUsually these types of changes are tough to get off the ground, but after the initial rollout, the feedback was all positive, and the team was very impressed. While some were thinking this was a temporary solution, we all know now that\u2019s not the case \u2013 now that the tool has been implemented and it\u2019s so easy to use, we\u2019re getting great feedback.\u201d\u00a0\u2013 Chiara Frausin Global Supplier & CoPack Data Analyst at Kraft Heinz.

The company operates across 40 countries with more than 20,000 field engineers. Committed to modernizing infrastructure in urban spaces, it has recently invested in new technologies like touchless building components and antimicrobial surfaces. The Challenge Five years ago, the client launched a technical help desk (THD) to assist its technicians with field maintenance. It hoped to reduce the number of times second and third field techs were dispatched to a job site to troubleshoot an issue, instead training technicians to call the THD and speak with an expert remotely when problems arose. If a solution could not be reached over the phone, a video call could be launched through the Salesforce platform. Of about 200 THD inquiries per day, the company estimated that between 8% and 10% used video calls, typically the most complex or challenging cases. The previous remote assistance supplier led to problems such as extensive setup time, limited Salesforce integration, and mixed user experience feedback. \u201cIt undermined what we were trying to do,\u201d\u00a0the manager said.\u00a0\u201cIf techs were telling us the call quality was spotty or the app collapsed while they were using it, it was difficult for us to encourage broader usage or promote the technical help desk as a positive change.\u201d The client was eager to transition to a solution that also allowed the seamless integration of data collection in real-time with Salesforce. Integrated global data could then be analyzed to refine remote assistance processes, targeting situations and business areas needing improvement and driving greater operational efficiency. The Solution The client chose SightCall for its virtual assistance needs, attracted to its ease of integration with Salesforce. The company seamlessly transitioned its 700 THD agents onto the platform within a matter of days. Once the need for a video call was determined case-by-case, an agent could assist technicians remotely through augmented reality (AR) and artificial intelligence tools. The calls were launched from within the technician\u2019s Salesforce console on their phone, without any need for additional apps or tools. With SightCall\u2019s advanced AR capabilities, agents harnessed tools like remote activation of the smartphone camera to illuminate dark spaces, direct annotation of items of interest by drawing or marking on the screen, and Smart Optical Character Recognition capturing text, barcode or QR codes for immediate transfer. Because the data from each session is instantly fed back to the Salesforce work order, with little to no button-clicking or manual syncing required, the client was also able to realize its goal of collecting information across different job types and curating it in a central database for strategic use. The Results Within six months of deploying SightCall, the client saw a 19% decrease in its technician callout rate and a 50% increase in first-time fix rates, which now exceed 80%. For a company committed to improving its carbon footprint, the reduction in truck trips also created what one of its IoT architects called\u00a0\u201ca huge leap forward.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no question that SightCall was a game-changer for us,\u201d\u00a0he said.\u00a0\u201cFrom the high-definition call quality to the self-training opportunities virtual assistance provides for technicians, the entire process has improved our key performance indicators beyond expectation.\u201d With the COVID-19 pandemic reducing the need for some remote calls because of the reduced use of elevators, the data the client compiled from hundreds of SightCall sessions allowed for remote support resources to be quickly and efficiently mobilized to other business areas. \u201cWe didn\u2019t even need to think about it,\u201d\u00a0stated another manager.\u00a0\u201cWe knew exactly where else this technology could be used and were up and running almost instantly.\u201d Solve Issues Faster with Live Visual Support Get a Demo Get Connected!

As a leading safety manufacturer specializing in protection mechanisms, they have over 75 years of experience ensuring the safety of their clients by providing specialized equipment and expert field service. They specialize in explosion protection, fire protection, and pressure relief through manufacturing and servicing safety components for business-critical machines and processes. Fike was using a complex web of legacy systems that resulted in expensive technician training, longer response times, and siloed data. Digital transformation was a priority, even before the COVID-19 crisis served as a catalyst for immediate change. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone through a metamorphosis. We\u2019ve been challenged by our CTO and executive leadership to reinvent everything we do. We see COVID as an opportunity for us to emerge as a completely reformed company.\u201d \u2013 Chad Lowman, Director, Corp Business Systems at Fike Selecting the Right Remote Solution After selecting Salesforce Customer 360 to streamline their quoting processes and connect their data, Fike partnered with SightCall to launch virtual field service. With lives depending on their precise expert support, Fike needed a robust visual assistance solution that could integrate seamlessly with their Salesforce systems and support their processes remotely. When selecting a visual assistance platform for remote diagnostics and automated service, Fike made sure to include technicians on their selection committee. During a two-month period of rapid prototyping, they used a team of service engineers and technicians to walk through real scenarios and give feedback on what they needed to be successful to the engineers and design team. Giving technicians ownership and a stake in the new solution removed barriers from adopting new processes, and the technicians were enthusiastic about the intuitive features of SightCall and how it enabled them to collect all the data they needed in a quick and efficient way. Shifting to Virtual Assistance SightCall for Salesforce was deployed in just forty-eight hours, immediately increasing efficiency, shortening training times, and increasing both customer and technician satisfaction. The solution allows Fike to remotely train technicians onsite and easily walk them through repair processes. With faster virtual processes and seamless data tracking, efficiency has increased across every aspect of the business. \u201cWe\u2019re able to see what the customer sees within minutes of sending that link. They can be our eyes and ears. We can safely look at their processes and critical equipment together, providing the trusted feedback we\u2019re known for by leveraging the expertise of our senior engineers through the visual support.\u201d \u2013 Chad Lowman, Director, Corp Business Systems, Fike Corporation Benefits Across the Board Customer feedback was immediately positive. Previously, when service was required there was a long period of back and forth to schedule a time that worked, plus hours or even days of travel. With SightCall, customers receive a link to a visual support session via text or email and can talk to an expert technician within minutes. While not everything can be serviced virtually, Fike is able to provide their expert-level feedback almost instantly when it\u2019s needed most. With unnecessary truck rolls eliminated, site visits when needed can be more easily scheduled and problems can be resolved the first time out. Customers also love the access to the data they need. Since deploying SightCall, Fike has seen a 90% reduction in travel costs and a 70% decrease in customer response times. Onboarding and Training with SightCall According to a report from The Service Council: 70% of field service organizations reported that they were concerned about knowledge loss due to a large retiring workforce and insufficient incoming workers. 52% of the same organizations plan to address the aging workforce crisis by introducing mentorship programs 58% believe that the situation will drive interest in Augmented Reality technology Remote field service with SightCall has helped Fike in training and onboarding new technicians, placing them at the innovative edge of avoiding developing skill shortages. Junior technicians can join a session alongside their senior counterparts to see their best-in-class support in action, allowing Fike to onboard and nurture internal talent in real-world settings while providing excellent service to their customers. Far from seeing this as a temporary shift during the COVID crises, Fike envisions that remote field service will continue to be the norm for many types of jobs. As virtual support continues to evolve, Fike is positioning itself to be at the cutting edge. The accuracy of AR measurements with smartphones and wearables allows for remote precision allows for a great opportunity for quoting new projects without a truck roll. The Future of Field Service Fike also sees a lot of potential for IoT integrations that will allow them to help their customers identify and solve potential problems before they happen. By installing assets in the field that feed data into the cloud, their customers can log in and see their entire systems, get notifications of over pressurizations for example, and identify how to correct them immediately with the knowledge that expert technician advice is just a SightCall session away.

Supporting major mining activity with over 60,000 employees in service centers and manufacturing facilities in 142 countries across the globe, this company realized the power of digital transformation to continue its mission to revolutionize mining for a sustainable future while providing exceptional service to its customers. Mining equipment is precise, powerful, and crucial to a mine\u2019s operations and revenue generation. Not only can unplanned downtime be costly, but it can also sometimes incur additional fines. The manufacturer realized the potential for remote visual assistance to reduce downtime, a significant value-add for their partners, while increasing efficiency, safety, and sustainability. The Power of a Global Video Platform By partnering with SightCall, the manufacturer can now connect their onsite field technicians directly with experts in the factory to troubleshoot, triage, and initiate repairs in a matter of minutes. The platform performs well even with low bandwidth, which was a key requirement for technicians working from mining sites all over the world. The ability to store data from SightCall sessions directly into client case files in Salesforce, including troubleshooting steps or any needed replacement parts, was an important differentiator in digitally transforming their leading service offering. During the support process, onsite technicians sometimes need to have their hands free. SightCall\u2019s support for RealWear glasses, in addition to a variety of handheld devices, was important. Sustainable, Efficient, On-Demand Support Delivered Remotely With remote visual assistance, powered by SightCall, the manufacturer can essentially teleport their experts anywhere in the world to give instant help to their technicians and the mining clients and operations they support. Reducing travel not only reduces downtime, but it\u2019s also an important part of a commitment to increasing sustainability in the mining industry. Customers of the manufacturer save money and are more satisfied with the services they receive. As an example, machinery downtime can cost mines between $60,000 and $80,000 an hour, and in some cases trigger additional penalties. Since deploying SightCall, the average resolution time for support has been reduced from two days to two hours. This means a potential savings of up to $368,000 for every piece of equipment that needs attention. \u201cJust being able to have a data analyst look at the machine in many cases provided an easy fix, saving hours of downtime. Using SightCall increases safety, sustainability, and satisfaction while reducing risks and drastically reducing downtime.\u201d \u2013 Head of Service Operations Solve Issues Faster with Live Visual Support Get a Demo Get Connected!

The company designs, produces and delivers innovative aerospace solutions with the aim to create a better-connected, safer and more prosperous world. Their cutting-edge products and services span the commercial aircraft, helicopter, defence, security and space segments, and are recognized around the world. The Challenge To reduce the costs of manufacturing, Airbus sought to improve time to resolution on their final production line. Historically when a production issue was detected, email, photos and other forms of media would be used to communicate issues between onsite technicians and remote experts. This communication was asynchronous and would slow down the repair process. The Solution Airbus partnered with Accenture who helped them leverage SightCall to improve the flow of communication and provide remote support. With SightCall, workers can initiate a live visual support session with the subject matter expert of their choice, using one-click automatic call distribution. During the visual support session, the remote technician can see the issue and help the onsite technician to address the problem, instead of traveling to assist at the job site. The Benefits The addition of SightCall on the Airbus production line not only boosted productivity, but it provided employees with a better working environment. 96% of users confirmed that SightCall\u2019s remote-support offering enabled them to solve an issue more quickly, and the average time to resolve issues was reduced by 60 minutes.

Sciex equipment helps change the world. As leaders in the field of mass spectrometry for 50 years, Sciex manufactures precision machines that help medical professionals, scientists and researchers break new ground, cure diseases, and protect the environment. Sciex customers \u201cprotect and advance the wellness and safety of all\u201d and develop \u201csolutions that influence life-changing research and outcomes.\u201d But none of those things can happen if a machine isn\u2019t working. Every day of down time is another day of not moving forward. That\u2019s why Sciex wanted to raise their level of service. They wanted a technology that could diagnose problems faster and increase first-time-fix rates. The solution they found was\u00a0SightCall Visual Support. \u201cThis is more than just having a video call with a customer. The functionality is absolutely transformational for our business. We can annotate, we can share documents and diagrams, and we steer customers to the actions we want them to take.\u201d \u2013 Senior Service Manager for Oceania & ASEAN at Sciex About\u00a0Sciex As part of the Danaher family of global life science and technology innovators, Sciex is a trusted partner to scientists and lab analysts around the world. Their mission is to \u201cdeliver solutions for the precision detection and quantification of molecules, empowering our customers to protect and advance the wellness and safety of all.\u201d Sciex innovations help protect the environment and our global food supply, advance our understanding of diseases, enable researchers to improve clinical tests, and empower pharmaceutical companies to develop more effective drugs, quicker and at a lower cost. Challenge In the Life Sciences industry, uptime is essential. Users of complex and precision machinery need immediate support when they come up against service issues and can\u2019t afford to wait days or weeks for maintenance or repair work. Every hour a machine isn\u2019t working can impact productivity, customer satisfaction, and revenue. Sciex needed a new way to speed up the diagnosis and repair cycle. But they need a partner that could seamlessly integrate and work within multiple complex CRM systems. \u201cSecurity is fundamental to the Sciex business. We looked at some of the free tools you can use in the market, but security is a huge risk there \u2013 but not with SightCall.\u201d \u2013 Senior Service Manager for Oceania & ASEAN at Sciex Solution Partnering with SightCall, Sciex launched its Sciex Now Virtual Assist service, that instantly connects Sciex customers with a network of experts from around the globe. Access to expert support at the click of a button enables customers to get trained eyes on issues immediately with accurate diagnosis and real-time guidance for quick resolutions, helping to reduce service wait times and significantly reduce costly unplanned machine downtime. A real-time view of customer problems also allows Sciex to be better prepared if an engineer is needed on-site. Specialized parts or tools can be ordered and shipped in advance to reduce any delays. Adding visual assistance technology to its service agreements allowed Sciex to exceed service expectations. The solution was quick to deploy, straightforward to use and accessible for field technicians. It also offered enhanced compliance, security, and transparency as Sciex supports customers throughout APAC, including China. Tightly integrated into its Salesforce and ServiceMax environments, Sciex has been able to uniquely customize the SightCall solution to fit its business needs. Through the effortless connection of these disparate CRM and FSM systems, Sciex has created smooth workflows that ensure data can easily be tracked and recorded, silos are eliminated, certain tasks are automated, and customers are consistently provided a personalized and seamless brand experience. Sciex is also using SightCall\u2019s visual assistance integrated into both their technicians and customers\u2019 AR Glasses, enabling hands free work during more complex machine repairs and maintenance. Customers often prefer this option since it reduces the need for them to use their own personal cell phones for at work issues. \u201cSightCall is a beautifully integrated solution with ServiceMax\u201d \u2013 Sciex\u2019s Senior Service Manager for Oceania & ASEAN Driving New Revenue Sciex has drastically increased the value of its existing full-service contracts for customers through improved remote fix rates, reduced diagnostic times, increases in first visit repairs, and a large reduction in on-site repair times. Not only has this improved customer satisfaction, but Sciex has reduced the cost of contract delivery and is now able to drive additional commercial revenue for the business. The company\u2019s vision? Productize and commercialize a visual assistance service to offer this product to non-contract customers to drive additional revenue for the business.

Their responsibilities include routine maintenance as well as major works programs and new housing builds. They average 25,000 routine repairs a year, which are reported by tenants through a telephone line or customer app. As part of the UK government\u2019s \u201cDigital by Default\u201d agenda, the client prioritises digitalisation, modernisation, and transformation. Challenge First-time fix rates and the convenience of scheduling repairs were a pain point even before the COVID-19 crisis. Early research showed that the majority of tenants had smartphones and were comfortable accessing services online. The client recognised the potential for digital solutions to improve this process. At the beginning of the pandemic, Central Bedfordshire Council\u2019s digital transformation needs became crucial. During early lockdowns, emergency repairs continued but routine repairs decreased, with tenants reluctant to schedule in-person visits. A combination of virtual and limited face-to-face solutions were needed to continue services while minimising risk for both tenants and workers. Security was paramount, as well as the need for a solution that could directly provide resources to tenants and collect information about their needs including photos and measurements. Solution The Central Bedfordshire Council deployed SightCall in a matter of weeks to their maintenance advisory team \u2013 the ones responsible for responding to tenant repair requests. Using a combination of SightCall and diagnostic software, the team were able to triage repairs by viewing the problem remotely and consulting their technical documentation. This eliminated the need to have highly trained experts on the front-line of customer support, or a site visit. The use cases quickly expanded to the entire property team as well as asset planning teams. Employees and workers can now approve or void work orders, verify emergency requests, and plan and manage large renovation projects remotely. Benefits The need for multiple site visits and the associated travel time was drastically reduced, through guided self-service and the collection of more accurate information about the repair needed, including any required materials and tools. First-time fix rates have risen from 77.3% to 98.84% since deployment. Reducing the number of unnecessary site visits increases the total number of repairs that can be completed by the team. Within weeks of deploying SightCall the maintenance teams were able to clear the backlog created as a result of COVID-related restrictions. Guided self-service repairs for simple problems was an unexpected benefit. With minimal training, the maintenance advisors were able to use SightCall and their diagnostic software to help tenants resolve problems without the need for a site visit. Tenants have been very vocal about their appreciation for the remote visual support offering and customer satisfaction is at an all-time high in the late 90s. \u201cAll of our tenants love it. Our oldest tenant is 90 years old and she loved it. With SightCall when we do enter their property, we are fixing the repair issue immediately\u2013 not just some cursory sticking plaster and saying, \u2018I\u2019ll be back,\u2019 but a true first-time fix.\u201d \u2013 Kim Hopcroft, Operations Manager Central Bedfordshire Council \u201cWhat really impressed us was the speed at which the team were able to make an impact. The operatives adapted their process, and their customer engagement to leverage live video only where it added value. This encouraged the user adoption, and the results were very impressive. It\u2019s great to see an organisation react to a change in environment so quickly, and we\u2019re looking forward to seeing the impact in other areas of their business.\u201d \u2013 Richard Forsyth, SightCall Sales Director Get Connected!

By reducing the need for on-site inspections, they also cut travel-related carbon emissions. Iceland is unlike any other place on Earth. The North Atlantic island is the most sparsely populated country in Europe. The majority of its 385,000 residents live in, and around, the capital city of Reykjav\u00edk. The rest make their home in more than 100 towns and villages located mainly around the coast. Iceland is an ancient land of glaciers and volcanoes, with long dark evenings lit by the Northern Lights. But it\u2019s also a place where pipes burst in the middle of the night. A place where cars sliding on ice cause accidents and too much snow can collapse a roof. In other words, it\u2019s a place where people need insurance in case things go wrong. That\u2019s where Sj\u00f3v\u00e1 comes in. The Company: Innovative insurance in the \u201cLand of Fire & Ice\u201d Sj\u00f3v\u00e1 is a leading Icelandic insurer, offering personal and commercial policies. The company is headquartered in Reykjav\u00edk, with branch offices located across the country. Sj\u00f3v\u00e1 has been on the forefront of innovation and technical development within the insurance industry. In 2019, they were open to learning about technology solutions that could improve both customer and employee experiences when they connected with SightCall. The Challenge: How to serve better from anywhere\u2026 at any time? Sj\u00f3v\u00e1 wanted to make their claims process faster and more efficient. Here\u2019s an example of a typical claim for the company\u2026 Most Icelandic homes are kept warm with geothermal heating which involves moving water through the home. When a homeowner has issues with plumbing, the problem needs to be resolved quickly. Sj\u00f3v\u00e1 processes thousands of claims each year for broken or damaged pipes. Previously, when a Sj\u00f3v\u00e1 customer called to report a broken or damaged pipe, they would reach an agent. That agent would collect as much information as possible over the phone before contacting a plumbing specialist and dispatching the plumber and an agent to the site. Adjusters and experts often had to allow for significant travel time, especially if the location was in a remote location. And most claims could only be started after visual confirmation on-site, which meant the homeowner was left waiting for both the agent and the plumber to arrive. The longer it took to file the claim, the higher the risk of increased loss, costs and compensation for the customer. Slow resolution led to unhappy customers. The biggest challenge for Sj\u00f3v\u00e1 was finding a way to get better information instantly. Doing so would help make the claims process faster and more efficient. \"Our Goal was to unify the customer journey and the claims process... SightCall was a brilliant solution.\" - \u00d3lafur \u00de\u00f3r \u00d3lafsson Head of Claims The Solution: Faster and more environmentally friendly claims service Sj\u00f3v\u00e1 added SightCall Visual Support to their claims handling process. They also created a domestic claims team, based at their headquarters, to help leverage the remote visual support platform. Today, customers who call in a claim can initiate a video connection with a Sj\u00f3v\u00e1 agent via SightCall, which the company customized as a white-label service they call Insight. Agents can use Insight to guide customers in collecting images, video and other vital information to immediately start the claims process. \u201cIt\u2019s hugely beneficial for decision making,\u201d said Head of Claims, \u00d3lafur \u00de\u00f3r \u00d3lafsson. The ability to remotely put an expert eye on-site at the First Notice of Loss proved to be a huge advantage. By getting a preliminary visual on the problem, the company could quickly determine next steps and get a quick read on the viability of the claim. It helped Sj\u00f3v\u00e1 decide how fast they needed to respond. With visual context provided by SightCall, the company can better prepare the specialists who arrive on site. And those specialists can communicate back to Sj\u00f3v\u00e1 headquarters using the same remote video tool, which can also relay data such as measurements, signatures and serial numbers. Sj\u00f3v\u00e1\u2019s domestic claims team also provides a 24/7 emergency hotline for clients, who can initiate a remote video call with an agent. SightCall has helped transform the speed and effectiveness of Sj\u00f3v\u00e1\u2019s response and allows customers to file a claim in a couple of hours instead of days or weeks. In 2022, the company estimated that approximately 25% of all property claims were handled through remote services. The Sustainability Side Effects: Cutting costs and saving the planet While Sj\u00f3v\u00e1\u2019s initial motivation was to clear cases faster, deploying SightCall helped them win some national recognition for sustainability. The company earned the 2022 Environmental Initiative of the Year Award for their remote inspection solution, Insight, and for promoting the environmental benefits of windshield repair versus windshield replacement. Performing remote video inspections helped them dramatically reduce travel costs and time. \u201cIf we compare the average savings over the last few months, it can be estimated that more than 100,000 km of driving has been saved since the solution was put into use at the beginning of 2021. In this way, the emission of more than 15 tons of C02 has been prevented.\u201d \u2013 Icelandic Confederation of Business Members of Sj\u00f3v\u00e1 leadership received the award in October 2022, presented by the President of Iceland. \u201cWe want to take advantage of the opportunities we have in innovation and product development to improve our service to customers while taking into account the environment and the interests of society as a whole,\u201d wrote executive director of claims El\u00edn Eir\u00edksd\u00f3ttir. \u201cWe see this recognition as an incentive to continue vigorously on this path, and we truly intend to do so.\u201d Today, reducing global impact remains a key part of Sj\u00f3v\u00e1\u2019s mission to provide quality, innovative service to its customers. \u00d3lafsson also noted a small change in the employee interviewing process. \u201cBefore, WE were interviewing the applicants, and now they are interviewing us!\u201d he said. \u201cThey want to know what we\u2019re doing [in terms of sustainability] \u2026 because they are not going to work for someone that is not complying.\u201d Reap the Benefits of Visual Claims Learn More Get Connected!

The network features two teaching hospitals with 4,000 employees and 625 medical staff. Between all of its facilities, it averages more than 3,000 births and 80,000 emergency department visits annually. Its online patient portals hold 30,000+ individual accounts, and the network is particularly committed to harnessing the latest technology to engage and care for vulnerable patient groups throughout the region. The Challenge SightCall met the client at a crossroads in its journey of innovation to care for patients using digital tools. Administrators had wanted to launch telehealth and virtual physician visits for several years but felt unsuccessful in realizing an effective and fully-integrated system all parties were on board with using. The company had established a care advice line with call centers staffed by nurse practitioners trained to screen illnesses and problems over the phone and recommend solutions. But because they did not have a dedicated body of workers to staff the call centers, departmental nurses often had to be pulled off floor shifts to fill in the gaps. The client also tried several different platforms to manage its care line, along with the limited number of telemedicine calls they facilitated monthly. With each, it encountered complicated training and licensing systems and little to no integration with Salesforce and online patient accounts. \u201cThey took forever to get up and running, if at all,\u201d said a senior IT director, when asked about the ability to quickly scale-up previous systems in an emergency situation. Some medical staff were also resistant to take bigger steps toward virtual visits. \u201cOur doctors were somewhat leery and uncertain about telehealth,\u201d recalled the network\u2019s senior director of primary care. \u201cThey felt it was a great concept, but they were skeptical about it working in practice. Nothing had come along yet that convinced them it was a tool to transform patient care.\u201d These factors worked against a larger rollout of remote solutions. The client\u2019s patient advice line fielded a few hundred calls a week, while telehealth calls hovered around 80 a month. Meanwhile, its long-term vision of strategically employing digital data to reach vulnerable patients and address health disparities in the region was restricted by the limited tracking systems of the platforms it used. The Solution When the client chose SightCall, it was drawn to the platform\u2019s seamless integration with its existing Salesforce Health Cloud system. IT specialists valued the ability to go live with nearly unlimited numbers of users in minimal time, as well as upscale call capacity at short notice. Physicians and nurses appreciated the platform was device agnostic with high-definition picture quality and low-bandwidth requirements. With augmented reality capabilities, they could guide patients through solutions to problems in real-time, using tools like annotation, screen sharing and remote activation of the patient\u2019s smartphone light. A live telehealth visit could take place at the same time the Salesforce patient portal was being navigated, without any interruption or screen changing. This meant the written patient assessment could be completed or in-person visits could be scheduled simultaneously with the virtual appointment. Alternatively, data could be extracted from the call and fed back to the Salesforce platform, with no manual entry required, using SightCall\u2019s Smart Optical Character Recognition tool. These benefits were rounded out by SightCall\u2019s full compatibility with GDPR, CCPA and HIPAA regulations, offering peace of mind for providers and patients, while satisfying the network\u2019s legal and compliance officers. The Results The client\u2019s adoption of SightCall took hold just in time for the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in early spring. And an IT executive said expectations were greatly exceeded. \u201cWe\u2019d tried several different telemedicine platforms, and none worked as well as SightCall did,\u201d she said. \u201cIt put everything into one easy, intuitive and flexible package. With the pandemic, our doctors didn\u2019t have much choice to come on board, but even the hardest skeptics have been completely sold on it.\u201d When the pandemic hit the Midwest, the network established a dynamic command center in a single day. An average of 80 telehealth calls a month exploded to 18,000 calls in April 2020 alone. Though these numbers eventually peaked down with growing numbers of patients returning for in-person clinic visits, by fall 2020, the network still averaged about 8,000 calls each month. SightCall set up a virtual waiting room to handle the increased volume of patients waiting for a provider if they were running slightly behind or needing to review records or test results. With SightCall, the client has also been able to track virtual calls and compile patient data like never before. \u201cThe dashboard has given us tremendous insight and analytics into the new patients that came in,\u201d added the IT executive. \u201cWe can now see who has come through our virtual doors, why they are calling and focus on that data for future outreach, so we can get those patients back in for primary and preventative care.\u201d The network is currently using the same data to target patient groups for the annual flu vaccine and will do the same for a much-awaited COVID-19 vaccine when one emerges. \u201cWhen I first started going around and delivering cameras and microphones to everyone, I wasn\u2019t sure how the doctors would react,\u201d she said. \u201cLooking back on it now, we couldn\u2019t have imagined how transformative SightCall would be. We\u2019re excited to see what the future holds with this partnership moving forward.\u201d Get Connected! See It. Show It. Solve It.

Braun uses SightCall\u2019s visual support to help healthcare providers set up and troubleshoot medical devices remotely, reducing service delays. This improves equipment uptime, enhances patient care, and minimizes the need for on-site visits. About B. Braun B. Braun is a German medical and pharmaceutical device company and leader in infusion therapy and pain management. The company develops, manufactures and markets innovative medical products and services to the healthcare industry. B.Braun has more than 63,000 employees globally, and operates in more than 60 countries. The Challenge Around 80,000 people in Germany currently depend on dialysis due to kidney failure. Dialysis patients must undergo long treatments at least three times a week in centers that can be far from home. This type of treatment complicates the life of the patient and takes away from their ability to work and spend time with their family. Home therapies are available, but less than 1% of patients use them because they are scared to operate the medical machinery without the help of medical professionals. The Solution B.Braun developed a new home service that empowers patients to receive kidney therapy from the comfort of their home. Patients receive a tablet pre-loaded with SightCall visual assistance integrated into Salesforce Lightning. With one click they can reach a medical provider with immediate access to the patient\u2019s Salesforce case history. The provider uses SightCall to see the patient\u2019s problem and guide them remotely through treatment. \u201cDigital technologies allow us to get in direct interaction with our patients and enhance their customer experience, confidence and independence \u2013 notably in home dialysis self-treatment. To have the ability of face-to-face communication with an expert helps the patients to feel more comfortable in case of technical problems or unexpected events. We prefer SightCall because of their seamless and powerful integration in our Salesforce-based patient application. SightCall\u2019s features and infrastructure guarantee reliability and scalability in other use cases as well.\u201d \u2013 Dr. Jan Lessing, Director Digital Innovation Consulting The Benefits Patients who dialyserate themselves, achieve better treatment results, have less complications and appear overall healthier physically and mentally. In addition, a successful home dialysis not only offers benefits in the well-being of the patient but also brings economic benefits and relieves our health system.

The company is ranked #31 on the Forbes Global 2000 ranking of the world\u2019s largest companies. The Challenge For decades, the insurance claims process has been slow and tedious for the customer. To maintain their position as an industry leader, Allianz sought a way to digitally transform the entire claims process. Their objectives were to modernize the claims experience for the customer, increasing the efficiency of their field adjusters, and improve the communication and repair process with craftsmen. The Solution Allianz deployed SightCall, allowing adjusters to perform live video assessments of claims damage from remote locations. During a SightCall session, the agent is able to see what the customer sees by handling the claim directly through the customer\u2019s mobile device. The agent runs the session, guiding the customer through the claim with AR and AI, and collecting valuable data like signatures, HD photos and geolocation. Allianz also deployed SightCall with technicians and craftsmen to collaborate on claims and fix damage more efficiently than ever before. The Benefits In less than a year of using SightCall, Allianz was able to process over 100,000 remote video claims and save their adjusters from driving over 6.3 million kilometers in unnecessary travel.

The client\u2019s diverse operations in more than 120 countries include oilfield services and equipment, gas and steam turbines, and eco-friendly energy projects such as geothermal energy, wind and hydropower. Committed to people and the planet, the company has invested heavily in initiatives to cut carbon emissions and overall waste as part of its growth strategy. As part of its efforts to accelerate carbon neutrality, the company has bolstered the remote operations and digital service solutions it offers customers with visual assistance and digital process automation from SightCall. Building on the Success of\u00a0SightCall\u2019s Visual Assistance The company has been using SightCall for remote visual assistance, drawn to its robust features and seamless integrations. On-site service engineers with minimal experience are paired with a skilled remote specialist to walk them through a project or work order, eliminating the need for multiple travelers to a site. Previously, the need for highly specialized engineers created the need for numerous visits, which was especially challenging for offshore oil rigs. Deployment time was measured in a matter of weeks instead of days. With SightCall, the client achieved hundreds of thousands of dollars in reduced travel costs in just six months, with significant savings realized on every site visit. With other efficiency gains included, these figures are even higher. The Need for Digital Process Automation While Visual Assistance helped reduce travel and provide expert support to on-site technicians, the process of documenting work performed was the next step for the client\u2019s digital transformation. Prior to the introduction of SightCall Digital Flows, engineers were using pen and paper to log their work, writing down what repairs and maintenance tasks they performed on a wide range of highly specialized equipment. At the end of a long shift, technicians were tasked with entering all their handwritten notes to their FSM. Inconsistent information and a lack of standardized documentation increased the risk for unpaid invoices, regulatory fines, safety issues, and potential shutdowns. In one instance the customer paid close to a million dollars back to a customer for a repair that was improperly documented because the work could not be verified. With a wide variety of equipment models and changing best practices, the client wanted to ensure that each technician knew exactly what tasks to perform while creating a standardized and auditable report of all work performed. SightCall Digital Flows in Action Now, for every repair and maintenance task, a technician can access a specific Digital Flow on their mobile device. As they go through the automated process, they are prompted to enter all relevant information and collect media, such as photos or videos. The robust features of SightCall help ensure the process is seamless from start to finish. Engineers can scan a serial or model number, automatically capture display readings, perform accurate AR measurements, and document and confirm their work on the spot. SightCall Digital Flows are designed in such a way that a continuous internet connection isn\u2019t required, which is a strong advantage to teams working on oil rigs or in other remote locations. Technicians load up a digital flow from an office or breakroom with a connection, then head out to do their tasks. All information and media are cached, then automatically uploaded directly into the correct case file when an internet connection is restored. Expected values and other information available in the Digital Flow are also available offline. If a technician enters an unexpected value in any field, they will get a notification that it may be incorrect, along with the expected value range, allowing them to check their work and documentation as they go. This is especially helpful when guidelines and safety parameters change or vary between different models of the same equipment. Following a Digital Flow ensures that the technician employs the current best practices for every task, without the need for continuous training which previously occupied 1-2 hours of every technician\u2019s day. SightCall Digital Flows and Visual Assistance work seamlessly together, allowing technicians to escalate to a video call with a remote specialist if they need further guidance. \u201cOur teams need to be able to simply click a link,\u201d\u00a0a senior IT executive said.\u00a0\u201cGiven that they are extremely busy, our engineers don\u2019t have time to learn something completely new. Any solution we implemented would be extremely high-cost otherwise.\u201d Putting it all\u00a0Together SightCall Digital Flows provides easy-to-follow instructions that make it possible for any technician, regardless of experience, to perform service tasks according to standardized procedures resulting in detailed documentation including photos and videos. With these standardized processes, the risk of mistakes and safety issues has been significantly reduced. The company benefits from having an auditable record of all repair and maintenance work performed, which in turn streamlines their invoicing processes and ensures compliance with all regulatory guidelines. With clear benefits to both the company and its technicians, adoption has been widespread and enthusiastic. \u201cFor a global business, SightCall was our only option, and its capabilities put us miles ahead of our competitors in terms of innovation. When we launched SightCall, it was immediately clear to us how this tool worked and the benefits it offered.

This enhances customer experience by providing faster, more efficient support without unnecessary delays. A European leader in user experience, with 17 contact center locations and over 200 clients, HELPLINE provides companies with user assistance and support services from its contact center, to facilitate the use of digital technology by all employees. HELPLINE\u2019S customers include the French franchises of one of the world\u2019s largest Food & Beverage corporations, for whom it has SLAs to respond to 95% of IT problems within 60 seconds. The designated employee of each franchise working with HELPLINE expects to connect with a human agent who can think, communicate, react, and adapt in a way AI\u2014on its own\u2014cannot. And the need is great. For these franchises,\u00a0every second of device downtime leads to missed sales and customer dissatisfaction. To put out \u2018IT fires,\u2019 HELPLINE sees AI as a strategic imperative and is actively pursuing the right implementation. AI is already used on one service desk, but for more wide-ranging adoption, HELPLINE saw its use of AI had to meet three essential criteria: Natural \u2013 easy to use and interact with Customer-centric \u2013 it must improve efficiency for the end user Mandatory \u2013 it will be part of the agent experience, not the customer In this context, HELPLINE evaluated different touch points for AI and how to incorporate it strategically. \"Each time a user from one of our clients reaches out to us, it means that person is stressed, even overwhelmed. An outage impacting his or her work could potentially impact the entire team's work, or even the company's. At HELPLINE, in a ense, we are the IT emergency first responders for our clients.\" Lionel Florence Director of Digital User Journeys, HELPLINE Driving Smart AI Innovation with SightCall VISION HELPLINE is now leveraging AI to reduce device downtime and optimize service with a different touchpoint: the franchise-side. With SightCall VISION, HELPLINE uses AI to\u00a0cut minutes out of every service interaction\u00a0by enabling franchises themselves to collect critical device information with a smart device camera and send it to a support agent\u2014before a service call even starts. After this \u201cPre-Call Information Collection,\u201d SightCall VISION and HELPLINE do the rest. The designated employee at the franchise only needs to invest a few seconds\u2014three clicks and one photo\u2014to capture critical device information. HELPLINE agents no longer need to ask repetitive diagnostic questions because they will already have all the necessary information at their fingertips. As a result of this minimal time investment, franchises win back several minutes (or more) in efficiency and reduced device downtime. The Impact of\u00a0The Right Touchpoint This key business outcome is underpinned by SightCall VISION\u2019s Smart OCR. When notifying HELPLINE of an outage, a franchise\u2019s employee, its PoC for IT issues, uses a designated tablet on site to identify the malfunctioning device via SightCall VISION. After selecting the IT issue, the employee is guided step-by-step to locate the device\u2019s serial number decal and take a photo. SightCall VISION\u2019s Smart OCR ingests the entire decal, uses AI to automatically scan the photo, pinpoint the serial number, and identify the malfunctioning device. Then, it uses an asset management integration to identify more critical information, such as where the device is, which franchise employee is using it, and when it was put in operation. The employee no longer wastes time verbalizing a string of numbers and letters or broadly describing a device to diagnose a problem. Each piece of collected information goes instantly to a HELPLINE agent. After a pre-call process lasting only few seconds, the HELPLINE agent has all of the information needed to provide accurate, contextualized, and personalized service. Instead of asking repetitive identifying questions at the beginning of an interaction, HELPLINE agents can dive directly into resolving problems, saving time, energy, and cost while fulfilling their SLAs and improving CX. How It Works Step 1 Franchise employee contacts IT Support for help with an issue Step 2 Employee collects equipment\u2019s serial number with Smart OCR Step 3 HELPLINE agent receives information before IT support call begins Step 4 HELPLINE agent guides the franchise employee through resolving the issue \"At HELPLINE we are convinced that the most important quality of IT support for users is still human contact, for their ability to listen and support with empathy. This comes from our knowledge of users and their needs, enabling us to know how to integrate AI into a digital journey and train it to provide support that ensures it is accepted, adopted, and meets the expectations of our users.\" Lionel Florence Director of Digital User Journeys, HELPLINE The Future of AI in CX AI in the contact center is here to stay, but it is only as good as the touchpoint, implementation strategy, and focus on supporting personalized, empathic support interactions. SightCall VISION and HELPLINE will continue to drive CX together by strategically using AI to enable customers, empower agents, and streamline operations.

The company is an industry innovator in solutions to reduce care costs and improve patient satisfaction. Its ambulatory surgery division features close to 300 locations across the country, and its growing home healthcare, hospice, and infusion therapy division operates in nine states with nearly 4,000 members of staff. SightCall worked closely with its physician staffing arm, the largest of its kind in the United States. The Challenge Like others in the healthcare industry, the company\u2019s operations were placed under unique and unprecedented strain with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Early on, experts were still learning how the virus could be transmitted and considering the most effective safety measures. But it was immediately clear the healthcare group needed a technological solution to create a safe airspace between patients and providers. The client called its vision E-PPE, or electronic personal protective equipment. The goal was for the physician to be able to achieve social distancing for their and their patients\u2019 protection by completing as much work as possible remotely, which would also respect the strain placed on medical and personal protective equipment by the pandemic. The solution needed to be customizable to its existing Salesforce platform and quickly mobilized for large-scale use, as well as feature high-definition image quality to allow physicians to work remotely with minimal disruption. The company also expected an enterprise-grade tool with full HIPAA and data regulation compliance. The Solution The client chose SightCall for its E-PPE, employing it through Salesforce Health Cloud.\u202fIts healthcare professionals are working remotely to evaluate patients, check vitals, study diagnostic scans and make important care decisions \u2014 all without clinicians physically going into a patient room. Physicians, patients and their family members are able to collaborate and discuss care in a safe, physically distanced way that does not compromise the quality of patient care. Patients\u2019 own devices can be used to launch SightCall remote sessions, with no additional equipment or tools required. Its versatility is such that physicians use it to make virtual rounds throughout hospital wards, employing several system features. With remote zoom, the call camera can be strategically positioned to view the monitoring system showing patient vitals. Physicians then take screenshots of vital sign information with HD photos, and using the\u00a0Smart Optical Character Recognition\u00a0tool, feed the information back to patient charts on Salesforce, with no manual data entry required. The same HD picture quality and\u00a0reliable video, regardless of connectivity and network conditions, made physicians trust SightCall for tele-triage in their emergency departments. This process facilitates efforts to separate EDs between general acute care and COVID-19-suspected patient populations for everyone\u2019s safety. In hospitals with a limited number of intensive care beds, SightCall is used by physicians and medical teams to create overflow ICUs within the ED, with initial assessments and facility rounds performed through the same remote calls. For the most serious cases in palliative care, multi-party virtual calls can bring the patient on video with a nurse and family members so they can talk to the physician and make decisions face-to-face. In times where the COVID-19 patient is unresponsive or in a medically induced coma, the physician can initiate a call with no interaction necessary from the patient. Underscoring these capabilities is high compatibility with data protection regulation, such as\u00a0GDPR\u00a0and\u00a0CCPA, as well as HIPAA. SightCall\u2019s\u00a0HIPAA compliance\u00a0is ensured by end-to-end encryption of data, multi-layered access control for staff, admin and agents, code protection of virtual meetings and mechanisms to authenticate protected patient information transmitted over the platform, with no private health data stored by SightCall. The Results Since launching SightCall at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, the client\u2019s physicians have performed more than 400,000 total\u00a0telehealth\u00a0calls. The number is split almost equally in half between virtual health visits in the acute setting, such as emergency departments, ICUs and ambulatory surgery centers, and virtual office visits. \u201cThe fact that we found a tool that can be used on patient devices is a tremendous help to these hospitals,\u201d said the client\u2019s chief executive officer. \u201cAs we know, they are already lacking in access to equipment. SightCall gives them the predictability that between 70% and 80% of patients have their own devices, which can be used for treatment, so the hospital can readily backfill the other 20% to 30%.\u201d For those patients without devices, the client backfills by attaching tablets to the same kind of carts that would hold an IV drip and sending these automated carts to perform the virtual rounds. Interestingly, the client reported hospitals that used telehealth calls more than others observed substantial increases in patient satisfaction rates and willingness to recommend the facilities. \u201cThat\u2019s a very promising sign,\u201d shared one of the client\u2019s IT directors. \u201cNot only are patients pleasantly surprised about how seamless the virtual experience is, but also they can see the positive transformation of care for themselves.\u201d One of the client\u2019s emergency physicians recalls how invaluable SightCall was in triaging one particular patient in the early months of the pandemic. \u201cWe virtually triaged a patient who came in complaining of chest discomfort, and one of the diagnostics we ran was a chest X-ray,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I remotely viewed the X-ray, I was able to determine pretty quickly that the patient displayed COVID-19 symptoms \u2014 and this was before their test came back.\u201d The patient was quickly isolated, mitigating contact between them and their providers. SightCall enables such fast and accurate decision making, one director of emergency medicine agreed, giving an unequivocal diagnosis. \u201cYour tool has allowed me to keep my team from getting sick and dying,\u201d he said.

By offering a one-stop solution for securing high-quality repairs for property damage and restoration work, they have earned a reputation as one of the nation\u2019s most trusted names in the insurance restoration industry. Standardized repair processes were impossible to achieve without redundancies and frequent inspections when working with large numbers of independent contractors of varying skillsets and experience. Without a streamlined digital process for performing and inspecting work, the client risked costly additional site visits, contract delays, safety issues, and even penalties. Choosing the\u00a0Right Digital Process Automation Platform To ensure the quality of work was standardized and safety protocols followed, the client sought out a digital process automation tool that would guide any contractor through specific inspection processes throughout the job while gathering all necessary information and documentation including HD photos and video. The solution needed to integrate directly into their CRM as well as a content management platform used to regulate access to media according to their in-house security protocols. Building on the success of using SightCall\u2019s Visual Assistance for remote support, the company chose to expand their digital services by adding SightCall Digital Flows. SightCall Digital Flows\u00a0Guide Each Step of the Repair Process Contractors receive access to a Digital Flow through a text or email link or directly from within the CSM. A Digital Flow can be completed on any mobile device, with all relevant information and media uploaded directly to the case file. These customized flows are completed before the work begins, while the work is performed, and after the work is completed and handed off. When kicking off a project, the Digital Flow guides the contractor to record a video of the work site while describing the work needed. The contractor is prompted to identify any safety concerns present. Selecting any of these triggers an action that immediately loops in the people needed to approve the work so it can move forward. A task is generated in the CRM, notifying the relevant party to review the case file and associated media. During the repair process, SightCall Digital Flows are used to monitor the quality of the work and identify any problems throughout the process. Contractors are prompted to take videos with commentary about the work for each relevant room or area in the house. If any safety issues or additional work needs are identified, they can be instantly sent directly to the team lead supervising the project, or to an insurance adjuster for approval. The Benefits of Digital Process Automation with SightCall By digitizing the entire repair and inspection processes, the client ensures that any contractor in their network will complete their work to meet universal quality and safety standards. Full and auditable documentation increases quality control, efficiency, and compliance. Most importantly, repair projects are completed faster, with fewer errors. Being able to inspect and approve work remotely with SightCall Visual Assistance had already helped to reduce delays and eliminates unnecessary site visits. As highly-trained specialists, adjusters\u2019 time is very valuable. Reducing the amount of in-person visits they perform leads to significant cost savings. By empowering contractors to collect all the necessary information with SightCall Digital Flows, adjusters save even more time by remotely viewing each work order that needs their attention. By providing everything needed for remote inspection and approval, time is saved and efficiency is increased. Digital Flows can also be completed without an internet connection. All information and media files are cached until a connection is restored. This is especially valuable in remote areas or in the case of repair work after widespread damage due to natural disasters such as hurricanes. When a connection is detected again, everything is uploaded automatically into the work order, ensuring that no data is lost and no time is wasted. Get Connected! See It. Show It. Solve It.

As early as 2017, iFit recognized the power of visual assistance to increase satisfaction for their customer service agents and improve the customer experience. By partnering with SightCall, iFit was able to streamline the process for repairs and troubleshooting for in-home equipment with a visual assistance solution that integrates with their CSM system and empowers their agents to help customers get the most out of their home fitness equipment. \u201cWe knew we could solve so many problems\u00a0if we could just see what the customer could see.

This improves efficiency, lowers costs, and enhances the customer experience. The Company In 1981, several French insurance groups, including MACIF, MAIF, and MAAF, created Inter Mutuelles Assistance (IMA) to offer round-the-clock human, medical, and technical support. Inter Mutuelles Habitat (IMH) is a subsidiary of the IMA Group, established in 2007, to provide policyholders who have experienced home losses with comprehensive solutions for their insurance claims. IMH operates as a remote service company, ensuring assistance, remote appraisal, and in-kind repair activities with a network of over 1,600 service providers in France. The Challenges Rising demand and changing expectations from customers meant that IMH needed to digitally transform its claims process to provide more efficient methods for its employees, while improving the experience for its customers. According to IMH leadership, the company wanted to broaden its competence and its offers \u201cby going to look for what we couldn\u2019t see.\u201d The solution needed to increase their remote service capability and reduce the need for experts to travel on-site. They wanted an effective method for capturing and analyzing visual evidence such as photos and video to support claims processing and documentation. And IMH wanted a solution that quickly, simply and seamlessly integrated into its existing working environment. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a technical tool, it\u2019s also a tool for managing customer relations.\u201d \u2013 IMH The Solution IMH chose SightCall as its preferred visual claims solution for several reasons: Reliability \u2013\u00a0SightCall offered a reliable platform for remote video support, ensuring consistent and uninterrupted service delivery, even in low bandwidth areas. Advanced Functionalities \u2013\u00a0The solution\u2019s advanced features, including photo capture, measurements, and localization, provided IMH with comprehensive tools for assessing and documenting damages. Simple Integration \u2013\u00a0SightCall seamlessly integrated with IMH\u2019s current platforms, eliminating the need for complex integration efforts. \u201cI\u2019m really happy, and you were able to see my damage straight away. I can go on vacation with peace of mind, without having to wait for an appointment with an expert in the field, which can take a long time.\u201d \u2013 IMH Customer The Benefits and Outcomes Improved Customer Service \u2013\u00a0SightCall enabled IMH to qualify assistance needs, visualize damages, estimate claims, and manage disagreements more effectively. Customers appreciated the ability to resolve claims faster and avoid delays caused by waiting for in-person expert appointments. Enhanced Employee Efficiency \u2013\u00a0Although there were initial concerns and mixed reactions from employees about adopting video support, SightCall proved to be a valuable tool. Employees quickly recognized its benefits, such as enabling them to handle claims that would have been challenging without visual support. Conflict Resolution \u2013\u00a0SightCall facilitated better customer relations by creating a more human connection and encouraging meaningful exchanges. Conflicts were more easily resolved through SightCall, as the platform emphasizes the human dimension of communication over the technical. IMH reported positive impacts from using SightCall, including improved case handling, shorter file duration, and smoother claims processing. Future Opportunities IMH envisions future opportunities to leverage SightCall technology, particularly by improving the process of visual documentation through photos. Integrating SightCall with their CRM, Microsoft Dynamics, is an ongoing project to enhance agent adoption, improve photo management, and consolidate usage metrics in global reporting. The aim is to continually enhance the quality of service, better understand policyholders\u2019 situations, and streamline claims management processes. Conclusion By adopting SightCall as their video support solution, IMH successfully transformed their claims management process, providing more efficient remote assistance, more accurate damage appraisal, and improved customer service. SightCall\u2019s integration into their existing environment, combined with its advanced features, contributed to the company\u2019s digital transformation and positioned them for future growth.

This improves patient support, cuts down on technician visits, and enhances overall care efficiency. Client Apria Healthcare is one of the nation\u2019s leading providers of home respiratory services and medical equipment including oxygen therapy, inhalation therapies, sleep apnea treatment, and negative pressure wound therapy. Apria operates more than 290 service locations throughout the United States and serves more than 2 million patients each year. Challenge Due to the pandemic, Apria Healthcare\u2019s patients with respiratory conditions who already relied on regular care and functional medical equipment were now also incredibly vulnerable to COVID-related complications. This made it critical for Apria Healthcare to find a way to support their patients remotely without entering their homes. In addition to regular patient check-ins, the role of the Respiratory Therapist also includes assisting patients with the set up and troubleshooting of medical equipment such as CPAP machines and ventilators. Previously this equipment was installed and checked during in-person visits. Without the ability to do this, video was necessary. Legislation passed during the pandemic allowed for healthcare providers to use video calling software like WhatsApp and FaceTime for a period of time, but these generic video calling tools were not sustainable long term due to HIPAA compliance, security and lack of features beyond basic video. It was clear that there was an urgent need for a robust and standardized solution for telehealth that could also be used for visual assistance with medical equipment. The right solution would support their existing workflow, and allow access from any device with full HIPPA compliance. This would eliminate barriers for therapists and patients using different mobile devices or, in some cases, a home computer. The solution also needed to integrate with the client\u2019s existing systems, which included multiple legacy applications with Salesforce cloud technology. Solution Apria was able to quickly deploy SightCall for Salesforce and onboard a group of Respiratory Therapists to assist patients with setting up and monitoring their respiratory therapy machines at home, ensuring their respiratory care continued without endangering the high-risk group through in-person appointments. Patients can now join a video session from a SMS text message, email link, or WebRTC. SightCall works seamlessly alongside the Aprialink application in Salesforce allowing the therapists to initiate video sessions directly from the case file with all the patients\u2019 information on hand. They can record data from the call, including machine readings, directly back into the file. During a SightCall session, the clinical and logistics staff use tools like AR annotations to illustrate steps needed to setup or troubleshooting the patients\u2019 home devices. With the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) reader RTs can scan barcodes or labels without manual input, all while communicating directly through reliable live video. Benefits Since deploying SightCall, feedback from both the Respiratory Therapists and patients has been overwhelmingly positive. \u201cOur teams aren\u2019t able to go into homes but can work with patients on a call to give instructions on how to use the equipment. SightCall was easy to implement, and the support team was with us through the go-live and beyond. We\u2019re so happy patients are taking our calls, using our tools, and can solve their problems without a home visit.\u201d \u2013 Manisha Naik, PMP, Senior IT Director Apria Healthcare Scheduling regular follow ups is has increased healthcare access and patients have enjoyed getting to interact with their therapists regularly, increasing trust and satisfaction. \u201cA couple calls in and I had it down and was able to walk the patient through joining a call and it\u2019s been smooth sailing. This tool has made my workday so much easier, makes my job easier, makes me and my patients happier. Every patient I\u2019ve had has been so happy to see me and mentioned how nice it was to talk with someone face-to-face.\u201d \u2013 Alice Varra \u2013 Respiratory Therapist Supporting patients to set-up and monitor their equipment at home reduces delays or problems that could have serious medical consequences. \u201cI had a patient having trouble with setting up their CPAP machine who was very frustrated and wanting to return it. Within ten minutes I was able to help him, and he said he would try it that night. The next morning, I followed up and he said the machine had worked great and really helped him sleep.

This allows them to resolve problems faster and improve customer satisfaction. WashTec are global leaders in the car wash industry. They develop car washes and provide service for over 40,000 car washes worldwide. But the growing demands on their field technicians threatened to compromise the quality and speed of the company\u2019s customer service and support. WashTec needed to find a remote solution that could help them maintain an elevated level of service and minimize downtime, while reducing unnecessary travel. About\u00a0WashTec WashTec has been cleaning up for more than 135 years. Founded in 1885 in Augsburg, Germany, WashTec began as a manufacturer of industrial laundry machines. In the 1960s, there was an opportunity for a shift with the growth of the automated car wash industry. The company invented the first electrically powered three-brush gantry car wash. Over the last five decades, WashTec has become an innovator in wash technology for all kinds of vehicles. The company is future-focused and actively seeks out new digital solutions that will make for a better car wash and customer experience. WashTec installs machines of assorted sizes, from gantry car washes and longer conveyor tunnel systems to self-service car washes. They offer digital kiosks for convenient payment and custom wash options. They also supply all the consumables including soap, chemicals, brushes, and spare parts. But most importantly, they offer extensive service which includes regular maintenance, wash bay cleaning, cosmetic face-lifting, and repair of equipment. WashTec serves clients of all sizes. Their larger customers (utility companies, logistics and municipalities) use commercial machines to clean trucks, buses, and other oversized vehicles. But most of their customers are filling stations, grocery stores and small and medium-sized car wash businesses. Why Remote Services When car wash operators have a problem, they call the WashTec experts. The biggest issue for the company? With 40,000 worldwide, they have many more car washes than car wash experts. WashTec wanted to save time in two ways. First, WashTec did not want to waste time sending experts in the field if it wasn\u2019t necessary. Because of their growing footprint, it was becoming impractical, inefficient, and expensive to automatically dispatch a tech to every call. Rolling a truck only to have it show up and flip a switch or replace a fuse was a waste of labor hours and fuel. And sometimes, a fix could take two trips, because of an out-of-stock part or gap in communication. And since sustainability is a priority for WashTec, the last thing they wanted to do was INCREASE carbon emissions. While some triage and troubleshooting was already happening by phone, WashTec experts needed a much more robust remote tool. The second way that WashTec wanted to save time was for their customers. When the company gets contacted with an urgent repair issue that does require service on-site, they need to collect all the information needed to fix it right the first time. For owners and operators, every minute of downtime costs them money. Every minute that a car wash is not washing cars is lost revenue. The faster WashTec can resolve the issue, the happier their customer will be. That\u2019s why WashTec wanted to give their service organization a smarter way to serve. How We Helped WashTec implemented SightCall Visual Support as a white label service called Digital Technician. Our enhanced visual assistance platform blends the digital and physical worlds into a real-time collaborative environment that empowers WashTec employees and customers to solve service problems faster. Visual assistance changes the way that customers, product specialists and technicians communicate. Remote experts can visually guide customers to collect vital on-site information including high-resolution pictures, video, and serial numbers. While most problems will not (or cannot) be solved during a live video session, the biggest advantage of SightCall is that it gives WashTec experts the ability to put eyes on the actual problem. Everything they can see and collect remotely will better prepare field techs once they arrive on site. For customers, the ability to instantly connect with a Digital Technician gives them the assurance that service issues are understood and WashTec experts are working on a solution.

This allows hospitals and clinics to keep critical devices running with fewer delays. The Client GE Healthcare is a global health technology company specializing in the engineering and production of diagnostic machinery \u2013 including MRI, CT and X-ray scanners \u2013 and offers expert technical services to hospitals, clinics and medical offices to provide post-sales service contracts. Driven by a mission to create and enable solutions that improve the delivery of healthcare to patients worldwide, GE Healthcare has invested heavily in automated medical appliances, such as artificial intelligence (AI)-driven Critical Care Suites, image-guided surgical tools and predictive protocol ventilators for intensive care patients. GE is constantly investigating innovative solutions with the goal of enhancing patient experiences and providing immediate repairs in order to put hospitals back on the path to what they did best: saving lives. The Challenge When troubleshooting an issue during a field maintenance visit was especially complicated, a field technician frequently mobilized one of their peers or a more senior technician to the job site, resulting in multiple trips and greater labor costs applied to a work order. This often caused the affected machinery to be out of use for a period of time while a solution was found, much to a clinician\u2019s detriment. From the standpoint of a radiology clinic or a specialist\u2019s office, a day \u2013 let alone longer \u2013 without an MRI scanner creates a significant functional barrier. Patient appointments have to be delayed or canceled, and the scanner becomes unavailable in the event an emergency arises. GE needed to reduce any unnecessary downtime and ensure the equipment would be available in the moments that matter. GE Healthcare\u2019s goal was to shorten the length of time on-site and improve first-time fix rates, reducing the need for multiple trips. When the company decided to search for a visual assistance solution, one priority stood out: the highest possible call quality to facilitate real-time work order completion and a higher issue resolution rate. The Solution Today, GE Healthcare complements its field support solution with SightCall, drawn to the ease of scalability. User profiles in multiple regions were set up on SightCall in a matter of days, and a global collaboration subsequently emerged. From Southeast Asia, GE Healthcare expanded remote service into China, Europe, North America and Latin America, and continues to build its relationship with SightCall through ongoing service expansion into other continents. The company also leveraged SightCall to assist in the maintenance and repair of certain product families, particularly medical imaging and ultrasound machines, where remote-guided repairs were found to be most successful. Both field technicians and remote experts praised the ease of use and accessible interface SightCall offers. Field technicians were impressed by the reliable video quality and consistent audio and video. Technicians could carry out remote-guided repairs with greater ease and agility, thanks to touchless capabilities using the device of their choice. Site data, like product serial numbers, could be fed back to the work order through the Smart Optical Character Recognition tool, with the smartphone camera simply held in front of the desired data to read it, with no manual entry required. \u201cBy using SightCall, we ensure that our field teams are partnered directly with our technical experts, making sure they are part of the repair and troubleshooting network every step of the way,\u201d\u00a0said a service operations manager for Asia, the Middle East and Africa.\u00a0\u201cWe can virtually place a technical expert next to a field engineer on a site by using the interactive video and augmented reality features of this application.\u201d One key area of concern for the GE support teams was the fact that many of the remote locations have low bandwidth or unreliable network conditions. In these areas, connectivity in hospitals can be exceptionally poor due to facilities being clad in lead to provide a safe environment for patients. However, throughout the testing stage, SightCall demonstrated the highest call success rates, leveraging its proprietary global cloud platform to deliver a consistent service experience. Remote technicians benefited from the ability to immediately share pictures, providing them the support and solutions needed, and could receive video help even in 3G environments. \u201cSightCall was stable and easily accessible throughout all of these tests,\u201d\u00a0the service operations manager observed. The platform\u2019s security capability is also industry focused, delivering HIPAA compliance, which is critical for GE Healthcare to operate in the area. This provides the peace of mind for technicians to collaborate anywhere in the world through the use of the same visual assistance solution. The Results Besides happier field technicians and a more interconnected organization, GE Healthcare began to notice an increase in several key performance indicators, most notably with improved resolution rates. Maintenance turnaround times were shortened to averages of six to eight hours, versus three days prior to the implementation of SightCall. With the average call taking only 40 minutes, the company estimates it has saved hundreds of thousands in travel costs. Research suggests an MRI machine faces an average of 30 to 60 hours a year in downtime. At an average cost of 2,000 USD per scan in the U.S. and one hour per scan, hospitals can easily lose between 60,000 to 120,000 USD per year on a single MRI machine. With callouts now completed in the same day, and equipment back up and running in a matter of hours, GE has realized significant cost savings. GE Healthcare\u2019s partnership with SightCall revolutionizes the way the company can support its customers, reducing device downtime and helping providers spend more time on improving patients\u2019 lives.

One of the world\u2019s most important coffee roasters and a global enterprise with products and distributors in more than 140 countries, Lavazza Group is accelerating its use of virtual assistance technologies to support the ongoing expansion of its product portfolio and continued efforts to become more responsive to fast-changing consumer needs. \u201c We are proud to partner with Lavazza Group to provide global service solutions for easier and faster product maintenance and repair, \u201d said Thomas Cottereau, founder and CEO of SightCall. \u201c Now more than ever, the world\u2019s top brands are turning to digital support that allows them to provide issue resolution with minimal service disruption. SightCall will enable Lavazza to work through customer care issues immediately, maintaining their hard-earned reputation for high-quality coffee products. \u201c SightCall provides the company with a comprehensive visual support tool for customer service agents to guide customers to troubleshoot issues, such as descaling coffee machines or basic accessory maintenance remotely. The AR interface lets remote agents draw, point and highlight onto the customer\u2019s smartphone, and high-definition picture assures the highest call qualities even in low-bandwidth environments. Device-agnostic, SightCall performs on a range of user products from smartphones and tables to specialist equipment such as smart glasses. Lavazza Group, with more than 4,000 employees and revenues of more than EUR 2 billion (2020 Financial Statement), switched to SightCall from a previous visual assistance provider. This decision stemmed from its desire to move from a local approach to a global template offering maximum portability and seamless CRM integration, reinforced by strong GDPR compliance. Lavazza first piloted SightCall with its customer service teams in France and Germany in the middle of the COVID-19 lockdown in April. Customer support teams were impressed by the ease of use and the level of confidence quickly developed with the tool, providing them with good insight into how a long-term partnership would work. The company has plans to scale up usage to 130+ customer support agents in seven countries over the next three years. The company plans to cover multiple regions of the world where it provides products, bolstered by the SightCall app\u2019s ability to operate in 13 different languages. Lavazza will also increase the number of codes and use cases it applies SightCall to, with more readily available data from its CRM and responses to SightCall customer surveys telling it where visual assistance can best be deployed to resolve maintenance issues. \u201c Everywhere our coffee is consumed, Lavazza innovates to enhance the experiences of our customers and consumers, providing fast and accessible service when and where they need it, \u201d said Maria Cristina Aspesi, Lavazza Group Customer Care Director. \u201c With SightCall, we have chosen a solution that gives both central and local customer care teams a single, cutting-edge tool to help customers and consumers, increasing the number of support and interaction cases that can be solved instantaneously. \u201c Linkedin Youtube VISION Platform Remote Visual Support Knowledge Capture Visual AI Security VISION Platform Remote Visual Support Knowledge Capture Visual AI Security Solutions Customer Service Field Service Insurance Telehealth Solutions Customer Service Field Service Insurance Telehealth Resources Blog Podcast News Support Resources Blog Podcast News Support Company About Us Customers Contact Us Careers Company About Us Customers Contact Us Careers Get a Demo \u00a9 SightCall 2025.

SightCall enables Peak Scientific to deliver its industry-leading Visual Support offering remote technical assistance to customers using their generators as well technicians servicing generators in the field. \u201cService is a top priority for Peak Scientific. Offering Visual Support via the SightCall application will close the distance between us and our global customer base, allowing us to accurately diagnose problems remotely and support on-site technicians. During the test period alone, we\u2019ve achieved a 97% first-time fix rate.\u201d Mike Hughes, Global Service Delivery Manager, Peak Scientific. Customers who contact the technical support desk for service questions can now be seamlessly routed to a SightCall video session that is integrated into Peak Scientific\u2019s Zendesk customer service platform. Service agents leverage this remote support capability to triage, diagnose, and troubleshoot issues with reliable HD video and a robust AR and AI feature set. For Peak Scientific, remote diagnosis is a key element of introducing Visual Support using SightCall. If a service issue requires in-person service from a Field Service Engineer (FSE), the insights and documentation from the visual support session ensures correct diagnoses of the problem as well ensuring any specialized parts or tools needed to ensure a first-time fix can be ordered and shipped in advance. If the problem is unusual or highly technical, the FSE can use SightCall to connect with a technical specialist while onsite for better support and guidance. By partnering with SightCall to deliver Visual Support, Peak Scientific has been able to maintain business continuity, improve customer service, and deliver the technology and resources their engineers need to complete their tasks effectively. Adoption and feedback from FSEs and customers has been incredibly positive, with over 97% of customers that used SightCall saying it was helpful, easy to use, and they would use it again. Led by these early successes, Peak Scientific is rolling out Visual Support to its global engineer network, working in over 25 countries to deliver direct service to customers all over the world. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to partner with Peak Scientific to support their digital transformation.

Rather than using gas cylinders, Peak Scientific customers use their gas generator solutions which are a more cost-effective alternative. While gas cylinders need ongoing delivery, admin, and rental costs, gas generators are safer, more energy-efficient, and economical. Additionally, service is delivered consistently with on-demand, on-site support.

Providing industry-leading analyzers performing blood coagulation testing intended to clinicians and researchers all over the world, Stago is expanding its support and maintenance system to include high-quality video assistance calls, rapidly delivering service to customers when instruments require troubleshooting or technical intervention. With SightCall-powered remote video repairs, the company will reduce maintenance pull-outs by matching an issue with the most appropriate technical expert, shortening repair timelines and returning equipment to use more quickly. \u201cAccurate diagnostics form the backbone of patient care, and SightCall is thrilled to connect the producers of such sophisticated systems to an accurate, versatile and remote service solution for its customers,\u201d said Thomas Cottereau, Founder and CEO of SightCall. \u201cEnabling Stago\u2019s experts to troubleshoot in real-time will drive greater productivity and faster problem resolution through decreased downtime, enabling labs to spend more time on the work that is most important \u2013 diagnosing conditions and finding cures.\u201d Stago specializes in diagnostic products that measure the human body\u2019s ability to prevent and stop bleeding (hemostasis), and to assess the undesirable formation of blood clots (thrombosis). SightCall enables the company to reduce in-person technician dispatches, which involve extensive travel and physical stress for workers. These on-site visits have a mixed success rate at solving problems, such as when the first technician does not have suitable expertise to resolve the issue. SightCall connects the expert to the specific troubleshooting issue, delivers a solution in hours instead of days, and generates more cost-effective operations. With the COVID-19 pandemic necessitating the implementation of remote assistance, Stago was also drawn to SightCall\u2019s rapid deployment and upscaling capabilities, its GDPR and HIPAA compliance to protect confidential customer data, and its seamless integration into Microsoft Dynamics 365 allowing for a complete view of the customer service process. After completing a successful five-country pilot in 2020, Stago will gradually deploy the service worldwide, leveraging SightCall\u2019s on-screen annotation features and smart optical character recognition in. Quickly creating a global maintenance network through smartphone-based sessions, the company targets to significantly reduce the number of field service engineer dispatches, and following a KPI analysis, it anticipates a 2-4% productivity gain from reduced downtime after further integrating the solution. Stago is focused on increasing its support team\u2019s usage of SightCall by targeting 20% of future maintenance cases to be resolved through remote visual assistance. \u201cOur goal was simple: To provide an innovative service experience that is both visually impressive and technically effective,\u201d said Nadia Kerboussa, French Hotline and Affiliate Coordination Manager at Stago. \u201cWe chose SightCall because it is a simple, efficient video tool, easy to use for our customers and our agents.

SightCall provides feature-rich video calls to allow an expert to \u201csee what I see\u201d for remote assistance and support. Building off this industry leading visual assistance platform, the SightCall app now allows for simplified, more effective responses to work orders, leading to improved worker safety and decreased resolution times. Historically, field service has always been done on-location because there simply wasn\u2019t a way to accurately address an issue without seeing it in person. While that can be time consuming and costly in traditional scenarios, the pandemic has added an additional layer of difficulty. Working in combination with its visual assistance platform, the SightCall app enables field service agents to get the information and vision they need to remotely assess and diagnose issues and work to quickly resolve customer issues. \u201cWhile the immediate value of remote field service is worker safety, the long-term benefits, like faster resolution time and ability to handle higher task and call volumes, could alter the field service industry permanently,\u201d said Ben Pinkerton, VP of Product Marketing at SightCall. \u201cAs SightCall continues to advance what\u2019s possible with visual imagery, we have the ability to revolutionize established processes in maintenance and customer engagement that were once considered a matter of fact. Notable experiences within the SightCall app include: Field Service Offline Mode \u2013 Using the SightCall app field service workers can take photos and videos while offline, and the selected files will be automatically uploaded from their mobile device when a connection is established. When SightCall is integrated into a CRM or other systems, the files are automatically attached to the case, work order, etc. This reduces the workload for field technicians when they need to document work or perform inspections. Smart Optical Character Recognition (OCR) \u2013 Data entry can be painful and error-prone, especially when it\u2019s repetitive. With the new Smart OCR feature, the SightCall app can be used to scan documents using the camera on the mobile device. Only the relevant text on the document is extracted from the document and then automatically synchronized with an integrated system such as Salesforce. The user can create or update the record in Salesforce with a simple tap, eliminating the process of tediously typing data using a touchscreen. New User Interface \u2013 The SightCall app has been redesigned for ease of use. With more service organizations adopting video technologies to remotely perform field service work and assistance, it is critical that any technology is easy to use. With the new SightCall app onboarding users is simple and straightforward. When implementing SightCall\u2019s technology, customers have seen an 81% increase in first-time fix success rate, eliminating the need to send a technician onsite and reducing unnecessary truck rolls. According to the Technology & Services Industry Association, the cost of a truck roll is around $1,000, so eliminating the risk associated with sending agents into the field can provide significant cost savings over time. The SightCall app is available for iOS and Android. For more information visit https://sightcall.com/.

A large-scale digital health study by the American Medical Association showed that between 2016 and 2018, the percentage of physicians employing telehealth visits and remote monitoring had doubled from 14% to 28%. Unofficial estimates, including those by the AMA, put that figure as high as 90% now. Before and during the pandemic, patients reported high satisfaction with their telehealth experience, even those using it for the first time \u2013 and it\u2019s obvious why. They are afforded easy, same-day appointments with their providers and fast access to diagnoses and prescriptions, all from the comfort of their homes. Patients have been overwhelmingly receptive to this digital shift as a result. But why can\u2019t the same be said of their providers? In fact, a growing number of voices have observed that, ever since telehealth emerged, physicians experiencing information overload often found the transition to more virtual visits too demanding. Recently, Salesforce\u2019s chief medical officer Ashwini Zenooz penned an article for the Harvard Business Review. She stated that many physicians remained skeptical about virtual care and doubtful of its overall benefits, due to the perceived potential of \u201cadding to their already weighty technological and administrative burdens.\u201d Many feel an unpleasant sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, seeing another well-intentioned but negatively disruptive technological solution. The drive to adopt electronic health records a few years back, which produced record physician burnout, is still fresh on many minds. But the transformative power of telehealth can be maintained in two rather simple ways. First, providers report the greatest satisfaction with tools that are directly responsive to their needs. In other words, customization is a must-have. Telehealth also needs to augment a physician\u2019s experience of providing care and be respectful of the time and pressures they face, without replacing their services or making administrative tasks more difficult. Only then can telehealth prove to be a practical reality, rather than an abstract, distant concept. Thanks to omni-channel integration with Salesforce Health Cloud and other innovative capabilities, SightCall has responded to the demand of providers searching for a comprehensive solution. The device-agnostic platform featuring augmented reality (AR) and artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities is operated through the Salesforce patient portal, with no need for toggling between screens while guiding patients through solutions in real-time or additional administrative work related to adding and storing patient information or data. This can even be operated from a patient\u2019s mobile device \u2013 and in situations where someone who is seriously ill cannot set up a SightCall session themselves, activated without any need for input from the patient. The platform readily facilitates fully HIPAA-compliant visual assistance use cases and is also compatible with data protection and user privacy regulations like GDPR and CCPA. Providers use tools like Smart Optical Character Recognition, which collects and feeds data straight into the Salesforce patient portal using the device\u2019s camera. They can draw and pinpoint on the patient\u2019s device with SightCall\u2019s AR-driven annotation feature. Providers or patients can also be anywhere, regardless of network reception or bandwidth, and count on reliable video and call quality every time. The latter-mentioned tools only scratch the surface of SightCall\u2019s benefits. Because customers can use the solution how and when they want and need it, it facilitates seamless and rapid upscaling of telehealth calls in offices that previously used them on a sporadic basis. Data also points to marked increases in patient satisfaction scores in a matter of weeks after launching SightCall. Particularly in the past several months, customers have used SightCall as vehicles for customized remote care programs, from \u201ctele-triage\u201d processes in emergency departments to virtual facility rounds with cart-mounted cameras in critical care units, and the creation of overflow units in hospital and clinic areas remotely monitored by physicians and nurses. One major regional hospital employing it for COVID-19 screenings found the data collected during SightCall sessions essential for efforts to expand preventative care and outreach to vulnerable populations, expanding its community impact well into the future beyond the pandemic. One point that Salesforce\u2019s Dr. Zenooz made was how vital \u201chuman-centered designs\u201d are to mutually effective telehealth solutions. In many ways, this is precisely what SightCall provides. Telehealth is the direction of travel, and we are honored by the opportunity to make the continued expansion of remote medical services a smooth journey \u2013 particularly for our healthcare heroes.

TOMRA Visual Assist is TOMRA Food\u2019s new Augmented Reality tool that enables remote experts to provide specialist support to a customer or a TOMRA Field Service Engineer on-site \u2013 just as if they were standing in front of the machine. It enables TOMRA to solve a broader range of problems of varying degrees of complexity remotely. The result is more uptime and better machine performance for the customers. It also reduces the need for in-person visits. This advantage is particularly valuable in addressing the travel restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic and ensuring food safety in this situation. \u201cFast response time is critical for our customers, who deal mostly in perishable goods,\u201d explains Andreas Reddemann, VP and Head of Global Service at TOMRA Food, Aftermarket & Service. \u201c Machine downtime for them may result in a deterioration in the quality of their product. During the harvesting season, they receive a constant flow of material and have to process high volumes, so uptime is vital. That\u2019s why, at TOMRA Food, we have an ongoing focus on responding as fast as possible and in a way that is practical for them. When you have such a diverse geographic spread of customers as we have, it is not always possible to have the right Field Service Engineer immediately on site. TOMRA Visual Assist addresses this gap between being advised of an issue and being able to be there to support physically.\u201d Easy to use, no equipment or training needed; on-the-spot resolution TOMRA Visual Assist is very easy to use and requires no equipment other than a mobile phone with a camera. When the customer requests support through a message, email, or phone call, the TOMRA Field Service Engineer sends an invitation to initiate the session. When the app opens, it seamlessly links through to a call with the TOMRA expert best suited to help them with the specific challenge they are facing. When connected, they communicate through voice and video. The Field Service Engineer can direct the customer to point the camera of their mobile phone to show what they need to see. With TOMRA Visual Assist, they can also share with the customer documents and annotate images to explain and clarify directions. TOMRA\u2019s choice of technology also enables the use of advanced tools such as Smart Glasses, which provide an Augmented Reality remote intervention that leaves the customer technician or Field Service Engineer on-site with their hands free to operate with maximum safety. \u201cTOMRA Visual Assist enables a greater level of clarity in the communication and information transfer between the person on-site and the expert providing guidance remotely. It acts as the local eyes of the remote TOMRA expert,\u201d says Andreas Reddeman. \u201cWith this tool, the customer\u2019s technician gets the support they need to resolve the issue immediately, bringing the machine back in operation. If a repair requires replacing a part, TOMRA\u2019s expert can easily identify it and ensure the right spare is sent, increasing the first-time fix rate.\u201d Mobilizing TOMRA\u2019s global expertise to maximize machine uptime TOMRA Visual Assist also connects TOMRA\u2019s experts on specific applications or technical issues with the Field Service Engineer on site. This enables the Field Service Engineers to quickly resolve a broad range of issues with the expert\u2019s additional support. \u201cWith TOMRA Visual Assist, our most skilled and experienced staff can spread their knowledge more broadly than they ever could if they had to travel to every site,\u201d says Andreas Reddemann. \u201cFor example, once a Field Service Engineer has completed maintenance on a machine, they can connect to our technical expert who knows the customer\u2019s application and the mapping profiles of their product. This will help the on-site Field Service Engineer ensure the appropriate grading profile of that specific product.\u201d TOMRA Assist: services designed to deliver fast and effective support TOMRA Assist also includes three other types of support: TOMRA Assist 24/7 (telephone and email support); proactive support through the real-time monitoring features of the recently launched TOMRA Insight cloud-based service and TOMRA Remote Assist, which enables TOMRA service engineers to log into the customer\u2019s machine remotely. TOMRA\u2019s wide-ranging and expanding digital offering TOMRA Assist is part of TOMRA Food\u2019s extensive offering of digital services that cover the full customer journey: service support with TOMRA Care, training with TOMRA Academy, remote assistance with TOMRA Assist, testing and demonstrations through TOMRA Explore, education through TOMRA Talks, and connected services through TOMRA Insight.

With this partnership, TMNF adjusters can now handle insurance claims remotely during times of disaster, sharing high resolution audio and video between disaster sites and remote TMNF offices. Over SightCall\u2019s secure, stable platform, adjusters can provide an immediate damage assessment and faster payments for TMNF customers. When typhoons or heavy rains occur in Japan, insurance company assessors and/or damage appraisers generally have to carry out field surveys or document surveys to estimate what damage can be covered by the policy. The time it takes to pay out a claim is largely dependent on obtaining customer documentation, determining if a field survey is required and executing an onsite visit. However, during large scale disasters, such as earthquakes and tsunamis, a more efficient process is required to deal with the higher volume of claims. SightCall enables TMNF to immediately deploy remote adjusters who can confirm and document damage through live, AR-powered video claims. \u201cDue to Japan\u2019s proximity to the Pacific Ocean\u2019s Ring of Fire, the country has been greatly affected by some of the worst natural disasters of the 21 st century. SightCall makes it possible for TMNF to connect their customers and agents at the disaster site with their experts at the office so that they can accurately confirm the damage in real-time, without making the customer wait for field visits or go through the process of resubmitting documentation,\u201d stated Alex Leroux, MD Asia, Middle East & Africa at SightCall. \u201cWe are deeply honoured to partner with TMNF in the digital transformation of their disaster response and to provide them with a stable and secure communication platform that will help them respond quickly to their customers in times of need.\u201d This is a first step and both parties are looking forward to expanding the use of SightCall to other areas of the business and leveraging SightCall\u2019s integration capabilities with TMNF\u2019s claims system, and also AI technology, to continue to innovate and transform TMNF\u2019s claims process. TMNF and SightCall current Use Cases Include: Flooding: TMNF will be able to identify the origin and the scale of damage and immediately confirm what is covered by the insurance policy. Earthquakes: TMNF employees in affected areas will be able to use SightCall to witness operations on the ground, assess the damage faster and ensure customers are compensated faster. Water Leakage: TMNF will use SightCall to quickly and accurately determine the scale of damage and the origin of the issue. General Inspection: For a wide range of accidents, TMNF will use SightCall to compare the damage onsite with documents sent by customers, making it no longer necessary to request additional photos or documentation.

The partnership will bring the augmented reality (AR) functionalities of SightCall\u2019s Video Assistance to Coresystems\u2019 field service solution, allowing for field technicians to leverage augmented remote guidance from off-site experts. The continued growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) is driving the need for service technicians with more technical expertise than ever before. Indeed, in a recent study from The Service Council, 68 percent of respondents attributed the increasing complexity of service products as a driving trend toward AR solutions. As a result, there are fewer expert technicians who are able to meet customers\u2019 growing expectations with more complex issues, which then leads to longer travel times for each technician. As the IoT accelerates customers\u2019 awareness of service needs and maintenance, this exacerbates the wait time between issue detection and resolution. With the Coresystems-SightCall integration, service technicians no longer need to rely solely on phone calls or service ticket details to determine the root cause of an issue. Through this integration, technicians can now use augmented video assistance in a comprehensive field service management platform to better understand the scope of work long before stepping foot on-site, thus improving first-time fix rates and decreasing onsite visit duration. \u201cThe real-time connectivity of the IoT in a mobile-first world has conditioned customers to expect faster service than ever before, putting pressure on technicians who rely on traditional service methods for issue detection, such as phone calls and/or service tickets,\u201d said Thomas Cottereau, CEO of SightCall. \u201cOur partnership with Coresystems aligns perfectly with our solutions, as the coupling of our AR-powered Video Assistance with Coresystems\u2019 crowdsourcing FSM platform provides enterprises and consumers with a rich service experience the moment they need it.\u201d Key features of the Coresystems-SightCall integration include: Pre-service review: SightCall\u2019s video assistance applies from the beginning of the service request process, and the customer can connect with the technician via video through the Coresystems platform to determine the issue to be resolved. The technician can then use the video assistance to determine the scope of work, the tools needed for installation/repair, and how much time will be needed for the project. On-site support: For more technically complicated issues, on-site technicians can bring in support from off-site experts using SightCall\u2019s Video Assistance in Coresystems\u2019 platform. An SMS link will give the off-site experts direct access to interact with the on-site technician\u2019s camera screen, allowing them to provide on-screen assistance with zoom, remote annotations, HD pictures, and live pointer features. Post-work verification, assistance, and training: Technicians can review recorded SightCall Video Assistance inspections for validation, maintenance, and remote diagnosis in Coresystems\u2019 platform. The remote assistance capabilities drive efficiency in training processes as well, reducing travel costs for remote experts and providing a robust, interactive training experience for technicians. \u201cTwo key drivers for an optimal field service experience are first-time fix rate and duration of on-site visits,\u201d said Manuel Grenacher, CEO of Coresystems. \u201cThe Coresystems-SightCall integration uses the latest advancements in video and augmented reality functionalities to set the standard for those two criteria. Customers can expect faster issue detection and problem resolution from start to finish, resulting in better customer satisfaction and loyalty overall.\u201d The Coresystems-SightCall integration is currently available to customers. Coresystems will showcase demonstrations of the technology at TSC Symposium in Chicago on Sept. 11-13, 2017.

The RealWear HMT-1, HMT1Z1 (Atex zone 1 version) or RealWear Navigator 500 assisted reality devices allow companies who perform inspections to be more responsive for supervision missions with their customers, improve the efficiency of their teams, increase their safety and increase the availability of experts who remain remotely. RealWear devices allow on-site workers to instantly contact remote experts to assist them on a daily basis or during an emergency intervention. When faced with situations that require a high level of expertise, thanks to the devices\u2019 built-in camera, they have the ability to contact an expert or experts who can assist them in making decisions while allowing the responder to move freely and use their hands. Previously, they had to take pictures with a phone, email them to the experts and wait for their response, which significantly lengthened inspection times. By enabling remote experts to assist field workers, it\u2019s easy to work for more customers every day while reducing your carbon footprint with remote inspection. Where a surveyor might have been stuck for an entire day performing one inspection, they can do two or more remotely. This reduces the time required to meet customer needs. Our client Apave, an international group specializing in risk management for 150 years, testifies to the benefits of our assisted reality solution: \u201cThe project with RealWear is really beneficial for us as the use of assisted reality has enabled us to respond more quickly and efficiently to our customers\u2019 requests,\u201d explains Harold, Digital and Innovation Director of the Apave Group. \u201cWe are now more agile in the field. All we need is an internet connection and we can respond immediately with the highest possible level of expertise, regardless of location. The support of RealWear and Lunaar, who took care of the deployment, allowed us to be operational very quickly. The latter benefited in particular from the support of Lunaar, RealWear\u2019s Gold partner, which was in charge of deploying the devices as well as the associated SightCall video conferencing solution, as well as training the teams. \u201cThe use of assisted reality solutions was studied by companies before the Covid-19 pandemic, but it is clear that the pandemic has considerably accelerated the need for remote intervention capabilities,\u201d explains Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Vautel, Territory Manager Southern Europe and the Francophone Countries for RealWear. \u201cOur solution has been the answer for many companies because it is recognized as much for the technical capabilities of the devices as for their durability and adaptability to our customers\u2019 existing tools.\u201d Linkedin Youtube VISION Platform Remote Visual Support Knowledge Capture Visual AI Security VISION Platform Remote Visual Support Knowledge Capture Visual AI Security Solutions Customer Service Field Service Insurance Telehealth Solutions Customer Service Field Service Insurance Telehealth Resources Blog Podcast News Support Resources Blog Podcast News Support Company About Us Customers Contact Us Careers Company About Us Customers Contact Us Careers Get a Demo \u00a9 SightCall 2025.

Companies in the European Union are facing increasing global regulations around their environmental, social and governance (ESG) initiatives. Reporting on these sustainability goals is mandatory and businesses need to be proactive to stay compliant. Deutsche Telekom is leading the way with the help of SightCall. We\u2019re proud to say that our partnership with the largest telecommunications provider in Europe was featured in the German magazine ServiceToda y, which is published by the Service Association KVD. You can read the full article in German here. For non-German speakers and readers, here is an abbreviated English version: Deutsche Telekom Service GmbH (DTS) has approximately 30,000 employees, with a field sales force of about 8,000 who offer technical support, as well as consulting and installation services carried out on customer site. To reduce emissions and cut back unnecessary travel, DTS partnered with SightCall to make use of remote visual support solutions. SightCall\u2019s SaaS solution leverages video with AR technology and digital process automation to make the knowledge of service experts available to field services and customers in real time. In an initial pilot, the SightCall solution was used to virtually carry out on-site investigation for the installation of electric charging stations. Depending on the specific problem, expert technicians are often required to travel up to 200 kilometers to reach customers. Instead of holding the first appointment on site, during which the structural situation is inspected to determine the measures and materials required, this first inspection takes place in a video call between the technician and customer. Using integrated functionalities such as augmented reality notes, photo documentation and electronic signature, the entire process can be carried out virtually. Following the successful completion of the pilot, the SightCall solution is being applied in other use cases. It\u2019s used by service employees to remotely support customers solving problems themselves, and equally by service employees to support each other. SightCall also offers the possibility to track avoided emissions \u2013 travel time and travel costs, saved with visual assistance \u2013 which can be made transparent on a dashboard. DTS uses SightCall\u2019s Sustainability Dashboard and CO2 calculator. Using parameters such as the average fleet consumption and labor costs, and access to live traffic data, the calculator can provide a detailed overview of saved CO2 emissions and travel costs. The SightCall solution reduces the need to travel, which in turn leads to significant energy savings and reduction of carbon footprint. This results in a direct environmental advantage for DTS, in addition to improved social benefits for field service technicians who avoid unnecessary travel and stress. DTS wants to expand this use of digital and automated assistance to better leverage the knowledge of field service technicians, regardless of their location. ServiceToday is the trade magazine for decision makers from service, marketing, logistics and technology. For 30 years it has provided information on management, organization and practice in service, technical trends and their economic and organizational impact on training and staff management, about people, products and companies in the service sector.

People all over the world packed movie theaters\u2026 and avoided the water. Star Wars made an even bigger splash in 1977. Every year since, Hollywood has used the sunniest season to showcase its biggest, loudest, and most spectacular movies. Here at SightCall, our Summer Release may seem low-key in comparison (no explosions, car chases or giant sharks), but if you\u2019re in search of great new features to help you deliver remarkable service? These ARE the droids you\u2019re looking for. Here are three features worth the price of admission\u2026 Agents Dashboard: Easy-to-Read Metrics Insights What It Does Provides visibility and insights for all SightCall sessions. The at-a-glance dashboard can show you how many agents are available, how many agents are active during a defined period, average call per agent and average duration per agent. Why It Matters Data helps you make better business decisions. You can monitor trends for future forecasting and planning, ensure efficient resource allocation of agents, and meet SLAs (service level agreements for service). Averages can help define what\u2019s possible with an existing service desk and can be vital when designing a roadmap of where to go next. Agents Leaderboard: Competition for Continuous Improvement What It Does Adds an element of competition. The Agent Dashboard can display Top Agents (1st, 2nd, 3rd places) and Most Improved among other metrics specific to the call agent experience. Why It Matters Gamification strategy has a positive impact on the customer service department. It can boost the motivation and engagement of customer service agents by turning their tasks into a game-like experience. Results show agent performance significantly improves using gamification, leading to faster response times, higher customer satisfaction ratings, and increased issue resolution rates. And games also encourage teamwork. Gamification can be leveraged as a great training tool by encouraging agents to exchange tips and techniques that help their colleagues \u201cup their game.\u201d ACD Priorities: Resource Allocation for Faster Response and Resolution What It Does ACD Priorities can now be configured per agent on the ACD use-case in order to set the level of an agent. This helps admins place a higher priority on certain agents or teams/groups of agents. Why It Matters: Implementing tiered levels of support using the ACD Priority feature enhances the customer experience and optimizes customer service operations. Success of such tiered support can be seen through improved efficiency, enhanced skill development and motivation, and optimized costs of resources. For managers, it allows them to provide a clear path for agents who want to \u201clevel up\u201d on the service desk. More experienced agents can transition to handling more high priority and complex calls. Want to Learn More? All these features are designed to bring more utility and clarity to your use of SightCall. We are continuously looking to improve the way you monitor and measure performance.

Even IVRs and phone calls are notoriously not a great experience. If you are expecting to turn to social media for a solution to this problem, you would not find any reliable assistance. Self-service and communities also don\u2019t answer all your questions and don\u2019t solve all your problems, but don\u2019t worry, the video movement has started. Get ready! A very well-known French retailer named Darty took time and effort to be known as \u201cle partenaire de confiance\u201d, or \u201cThe partner of trust\u201d. In France, everyone knows their Kangoos, which are never too far from you and can come help you fix all of your home appliances and electronic devices. In the past 5 years, this company was able to transform its famous quality of customer service to the digital world and online shopping wave. How did they do this? By providing you the ability to chat with one of their service specialists when you have a question or a problem? Sort of. Darty took a step further. They believed that the human relation experience they provided in-person needed to be adapted to the digital and mobile world. Customer Service With a Human Touch Two problems arise from this new anticipated method of customer service. The first problem is Darty staying in touch with its customers. How can Darty always be one touch away? Darty materialized a genius idea: The Darty Button. With a mere click of a button, you are connected with a live agent within the next 5 minutes. The second problem is Darty keeping a human relationship with its customers. It became obvious that video call was the answer they\u2019d been waiting for. But how did they make this possible? Obviously having a skype between their repair technician and their customers would not have worked. Skype is based on a network of friends that need to be connected together. Skype for Business is based on the same mechanism, but it is based around groups of colleagues and business relatives instead of friends and family. The perfect match was SightCall, a real-time video platform service providing the ability to add video into Darty\u2019s experience. For the customer, this service is simply amazing. One-touch on the Darty button (physical button or digital button) and a Darty expert pops up on your mobile screen; he\u2019s there to help you with your questions or problems. He is also equipped with his digital tools, which replace his screwdriver and hammer with the ability to see what you show him and write on your screen to guide you through your problem. Not only that, but utilizing the panel of information he has access to on his CRM, your Darty service assistant can share with you the appropriate manual right there, live on your phone. I am impressed by this amazing transformation made by Darty. I am proud that SightCall provides them the tool to make this service real. This new customer service method creates an intimate relationship between The Darty and its customers, which is just what large business corporations need to maintain their clients\u2019 satisfaction. Bravo Darty, thanks for making your customers happy by staying so close to them, even in our digital world.

Customers use their cell phone or tablet to give the technician a clear view of the issue that they are facing. The Malvern Panalytical technician can guide the customer through a repair by using augmented reality tools to provide concise instructions. If an issue cannot be solved remotely, SightCall is used to thoroughly investigate the issue before dispatching a qualified technician to the field. Adding visual support to the service process eliminates repeat visits, improves repair times and enables safe pre- and self-install, while providing a better customer experience. \u201cAugmented reality has been in our road map since before the pandemic and COVID-19 created a momentum that accelerated adoption and reinforced the value of visual support,\u201d stated Richard Hulsbeek, Customer Services Director for the Tech centers at Malvern Panalytical. \u201cOur relationship with SightCall enabled us to respond quickly to ensure business continuity for the global network of scientists and engineers that rely on Malvern Panalytical technologies for essential material analysis in their manufacturing facility or research lab.

Mark, who is a seasoned group VP and consulting partner at IDC, named it \u201cShow me\u201d. IDC identified 3 different segments leveraging Video Communications Platforms as a service: Communication and Collaboration Education, social, and media Show me IDC is forecasting a CAGR of over 100% for the PaaS market from 2016 to 2020. What Is a Video Platform as a Service? First of all, I would like to better define the Video PaaS (Platform as a Service) Market. So, what exactly is this new animal? First, let\u2019s define what it is not: It does not include traditional video conferencing infrastructures such as Cisco, Lifesize or Polycom It does not include internal communication solutions such as Microsoft Lync renamed Skype for business It does not include cloud-based conferencing solutions such as Webex, Go2meeting, Zoom or BlueJeans Secondly, let\u2019s figure out what it is made of: Wikipedia defines Platform as a Service (PaaS) as \u201ca category of cloud computing services that provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure typically associated with developing and launching an app.\u201d In our context, Video Communications PaaS are cloud platforms delivering a set of APIs, SDKs and connectors allowing customers to integrate video communications into their software environment. These platforms manage and hide the complexity of real time communication to make customization and integration of video capabilities easy into any app and business process. The Difference Between PaaS and SaaS For Video Communications What are the benefits of PaaS video communication versus an enterprise Software as a Service (SaaS)? Wikipedia describes Software as a Service as \u201ca software licensing and delivery model in which software is licensed on a subscription basis and is centrally hosted. It is sometimes referred to as \u201con-demand software\u201d.\u201d SaaS video communication vendors deliver standalone applications that users can log in to communicate via audio and video. Conversely, PaaS vendors provide the ability to augment existing business applications with video as part of the flow. Let\u2019s take the example of a customer service implementation. Customer service agents are connected to their agent console that is connected to their CRM. They have a single interface they use all day long. Leveraging a PaaS video solution, this interface can be augmented with live video, empowering service agents with the ability to see what their customer see right in their agent console. In addition to the ease of use for the agents, logs, recordings, analytics are all plugged with the CRM in use by the organization. To the 3 segments identified by IDC, \u201cCommunication and Collaboration\u201d as well as \u201cEducation, social and media\u201d are standard and traditionally in use. The third one named \u201cshow me\u201d is fairly new from an analyst perspective. The definition of this new category could be \u201cthe conduct of a live video session allowing two or more individuals based in different locations to collaborate together while seeing what one of the individual of the session sees\u201d. Retailers and Insurers at The Forefront of Video PaaS Adoption At SightCall we simply call it \u201csee what I see\u201d or \u201csee what your customers see\u201d. To make it very concrete, here are two examples of the SightCall Video PaaS implementation: SightCall used by Darty, a French retailer that can be compared to Best Buy in the US SightCall used by Axa, one of the top 3 global insurance company As you can see in these 2 implementations, Darty and Axa both implemented a \u201cShow me\u201d use case: Axa transformed the claims process by enabling their customers to show damage in real-time replacing the need to wait for an adjuster to come on-site. Darty transformed the customer service experience by seeing their customers\u2019 questions or problems and guiding them remotely to avoid unnecessary product returns or technician dispatch It makes complete sense to consider that among markets leveraging video PaaS, the show me market will be the fastest-growing market in the coming 5 years. In a mobile world, consumers don\u2019t consume services and goods in physical places but in digital marketplaces. The services provided by brands, manufacturers, carriers, retailers shall evolve the same way. Why would you bring your printer back to the store to find out if it can be repaired or replaced when someone could diagnose the issue remotely, and eventually show you how to repair it in a few minutes? The technology is ready and everything leads to believe that the transformation will happen quickly as customer satisfaction aligns with business efficiency. Here are a few other signs to support my remarks: Five9 Summer Release 2016 enhanced its omnichannel capabilities with the easy escalation from one channel to another including text chat to video chat using SightCall PaaS Video. The Show me use case is even going further than the ability to see by empowering customer care agents with the ability to remotely guide customers. Agents can: Zoom to have a better view of the matter without asking the customer to go to the exact distance he needs to have a good view Activate the smartphone\u2019s flashlight to highlight dark areas Pause the video and draw on the screen to explain what to do Take pictures remotely to document a case Share technical documentation while seeing the phone\u2019s screen Knowing that a picture is worth a hundred words and a video is worth a thousand pictures I let you do the math to get a sense of the benefits video brings to the business to customer\u2019s interactions! Multichannel already embraced voice, text, and social media. The next big medium is video and enterprises can embrace it with a video PaaS. IDC report is available here.

In this episode of SightCall Sessions, we sit down with\u00a0Justin O\u2019Brien, VP of Sales for existing customers at NICE, one of the leading CCaaS platforms in the market. Justin shares his journey in the customer experience industry, offering insights into what sets NICE apart as an innovator in the competitive CCaaS space.

He emphasizes the importance of creating frictionless customer experiences and the role of strong partnerships in delivering seamless, integrated solutions that enhance customer journeys. Episode Transcript David Swift (00:00): Welcome everyone to SightCall Sessions. SightCall Sessions is a conversation focused on enterprise service, topics, trends, and technology. Today, we\u2019re fortunate to have Justin O\u2019Brien, VP of Sales for existing customers at none other than NICE\u2014one of the largest and greatest (in my opinion) CCaaS platforms out there. We also have Fred with us, our EVP at SightCall for sales and partnerships. We\u2019re really excited to have you, Justin. Justin O\u2019Brien (00:35): Thank you so much for having me. I appreciate the introduction\u2014you make me feel very important. As you know, David, I often introduce myself as a high-functioning idiot. I say that to caution viewers that I\u2019m just a nobody trying to tell anybody about the awesome stuff going on in CCaaS and, more specifically, in the world of customer experience transformation\u2014which, of course, you guys are a major part of. David Swift (01:09): Let\u2019s get started with some questions. First up\u2014could you tell us about your role at NICE and your journey in the customer experience industry? Justin O\u2019Brien (01:20): Sure. My current role is focused on working with our existing customer base. NICE has been around since 1986, and over the years, we\u2019ve accumulated more than 7,000 customers globally. In North America, we serve around 5,500 across a wide range of industries. My team\u2014solution account management\u2014works on consolidation, transformation, and expansion initiatives with those customers. It\u2019s an exciting time because there\u2019s so much innovation in the space, and NICE has been a key player in driving it. We\u2019re not just releasing products\u2014we\u2019re delivering solutions that integrate across the customer journey, from the initial need (booking appointments, filing warranty claims, etc.) to resolution. Whether it starts via phone, chat, Facebook, or a Google search, NICE enables full journey orchestration. As for how I got here? I started off as a salesperson. Actually, I was an actor by trade and needed a \u201creal job.\u201d I landed at a call recording and quality monitoring company. Funny story\u2014I once accidentally told a client named Crystal that I loved her on the phone because my wife\u2019s name is also Crystal. It was a mess! But a week later, I closed the largest deal the company had ever seen. That moment taught me: sales is easy when you\u2019re just yourself. I\u2019ve now been at NICE for over 13 years. David Swift (04:14): That\u2019s quite the journey. NICE comes up a lot in our space as a leader in CCaaS. From your perspective, what sets NICE apart? Justin O\u2019Brien (04:33): You\u2019re putting me on the spot! All my competitors are probably watching, looking for the secret sauce. The corporate answer? NICE has never shied away from innovation. We push the envelope with internal development. Many technologies our competitors now use started with us. We\u2019ve built brand equity over the years\u2014when customers have to choose, they often go with the name they trust. But we also know where to partner. Instead of saying, \u201cwe don\u2019t offer that,\u201d we find best-in-breed partners\u2014like SightCall\u2014and integrate them seamlessly. That way, we deliver a unified experience to our customers. Personally? It comes down to people. Customer care is the only sustainable competitive advantage. And people buy from people they trust. Fred (06:34): To that point\u2014Justin, you\u2019re not just smart and charming, you\u2019re incredibly efficient. That mindset runs throughout NICE, which is why you\u2019re so successful. Justin O\u2019Brien (07:34): Stop\u2026 keep it coming. No really, thank you. You\u2019re right\u2014it has to come from a passion for customer care. One of my first jobs was at Subway. I was told, \u201ca sandwich tastes better if the customer has a smile on their face.\u201d That\u2019s stuck with me. If you\u2019re constantly improving the customer experience, the results will compound. I\u2019m lucky to work for a company where that\u2019s our central focus. Fred (08:54): Let\u2019s talk partnerships. Why is it so important for NICE to work with DEVone partners like SightCall? Justin O\u2019Brien (09:29): Even with all our innovation and tech, customer needs evolve fast. We can\u2019t always meet those needs with our own tools\u2014and that\u2019s okay. Sometimes the best outcome comes from a partnership. That\u2019s where DEVone comes in. We don\u2019t partner with just anyone. SightCall is one of a very small number of strategic partners. Your visual assistance solution blew our minds. When I saw your demo, I wasn\u2019t just thinking as a seller\u2014I thought, \u201cMan, I wish I had this on some of my recent service calls!\u201d The ability to share what I\u2019m seeing and expedite the process\u2014it\u2019s a game-changer. David Swift (12:26): I\u2019ve been there too\u2014on a service call wishing I could just show them the issue. Let\u2019s shift to expectations. How have customer expectations changed, and how is NICE responding? Justin O\u2019Brien (13:25): Today\u2019s consumers want what they want, when and how they want it. Business hours? Gone. Just offering a 1-800 number? Not enough. People want options: self-serve, live agents, empathy, speed\u2014all on their terms. That\u2019s where visual assistance fits perfectly. If a customer could just show what they\u2019re looking at, support could resolve the issue faster\u2014with less frustration on both sides. SightCall helps eliminate that friction. Another key point: whatever channel the interaction starts in\u2014IVA, chatbot, live agent\u2014context should carry over. No starting from scratch. Customers hate that. Your solution makes it possible to switch modes while keeping the data and progress intact. David Swift (18:22): You touched on IVA, AI, and agent assist. How do you see AI evolving in the service space? Justin O\u2019Brien (19:56): It\u2019s a daily conversation\u2014times five. AI is here to stay. The question is: how do we use it safely, compliantly, and strategically? I like the concept of augmented intelligence \u2014supporting, not replacing, agents. ChatGPT has opened minds but also shown us the risks: hallucinations, lack of guardrails. At NICE, we build CX-specific models. Our AI only pulls from verified internal knowledge bases\u2014not random web data. It ensures consistency and compliance. Where it gets exciting is agent assist. Instead of an agent spending 3\u20134 minutes hunting for info, AI can surface the right article and pre-draft a response. Suddenly, a 10-minute call becomes a 5-minute call\u2014with better outcomes. AI is also helping supervisors. Imagine asking your dashboard, \u201cWhat\u2019s the #1 driver of NPS this week?\u201d\u2014and getting an instant answer. That\u2019s the kind of efficiency NICE is building toward. Fred (29:08): Besides AI, what\u2019s the next biggest priority for your customers? Justin O\u2019Brien (29:40): Honestly, it\u2019s still AI\u2014but within that umbrella, it\u2019s about solving specific pain points. Take one of our mattress clients. They had a long, multi-step process for warranty claims. SightCall came in and simplified it with visual guidance and automation. That\u2019s huge. Even with IVAs, we ask: what business outcome are you driving? Some want simple FAQs. Others need the IVA to act like a full agent\u2014gather media, do authentication, submit claims. David Swift (32:07): We often talk about visual context at SightCall. Do you see visual data becoming a key part of service? Justin O\u2019Brien (33:50): Absolutely. Visual tech is where we\u2019re headed. Think about how Google Lens has changed how we search. Consumers now expect that kind of functionality. Why should I squint at a 19-digit serial number in bad lighting when I could just scan it? Your tech makes that experience frictionless. Visual input becomes essential data\u2014and AI can use that to drive faster resolution. David Swift (36:36): To close us out, what advice would you give to service leaders hesitant about adopting new tech like AI or visual support? Justin O\u2019Brien (37:08): Do your due diligence. Not all \u201cAI\u201d is real AI\u2014some of it is vaporware. Second, ask: is this initiative for your customer, or is it just for the business? If it\u2019s customer-first, you\u2019ll likely make the right call. If you\u2019re forcing a bot experience to save money without a clear benefit to the customer, it may backfire. Always provide a path to resolution. If the first experience fails, the second shouldn\u2019t be more painful. David Swift (41:02): Thanks, Justin. This was an insightful discussion. Appreciate your time and perspective. Justin O\u2019Brien (41:27): Appreciate you both. You\u2019re fantastic. Fred (41:30): Thank you, Justin. You too.

See It. Show It. Solve It. Deliver Faster Service Meet Customer Expectations Reduce Cost of Business Get A Demo How can insurers assimilate InsurTech startups and technologies into their value chains?\u201d This question was recently posed by Matteo Carbone in his book, All the Insurance Players will be InsurTech; A wave of innovation is finally reshaping the insurance industry. Participating in the success of digital transformation for global insurance carriers like Allianz, AG Insurance, and AXA, I have seen firsthand how this question can be answered. The aforementioned carriers have completely transformed the way they interact with millions of customers from FNOL to repair by embracing video technology. In this white paper, we\u2019ll share the best practices and lessons learned along the road to claims transformation. Our focus will be on using remote video to replace onsite claims assessments. Today, video technology designed for integrating remote expertise capabilities is mature and proven. In the last year alone, over 100,000 unique users connected to the SightCall remote video assistance platform to assess claims, provide technical expertise, perform remote inspections, or simply see what the customer sees. We see that InsurTech platforms are being accepted at a rapid pace by European carriers and customers, while America falls behind. In interviews with over 20 U.S. Claims Directors, we learned that some implementations are failing due to a lack of following the fundamental steps that are required in digital transformation, and fear that their customers are not ready. In May 2018 we conducted a survey and found that an overwhelming amount of U.S. consumers are indeed ready for digital change. 68% of respondents would like for their insurance company to give them the option to choose between a video assessment or onsite claim and 22% answered maybe. This is a total of 90% of customers open to video claims. In this same population, 59% believe that an immediate remote video assessment is the ideal way to file a claim and 37% would rather schedule an appointment for a video or in person assessment. Only 5% of them expressed that they would prefer a chatbot interaction. 69% also report having never been given the option to file a claim using photo or video. If the consumers are ready, it is up to the insurance companies to listen and provide the adequate solution. The challenge is now to overcome the transformation of the claims process and the way insurance, third party adjusters and independent adjusters work. In this White Paper, we provide a set of best practices aimed to help this transformation.

Deliver Faster Service Meet Customer Expectations Reduce Cost of Business Get A Demo Experienced technicians are starting to retire in large numbers, causing challenges for field service organizations. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), by 2022 more than 25% of the U.S. labor force will be in the 55+ age category. Aging workforces are sparking change across industries and present particular challenges for field service organizations. In a report from Field Service News, 73% of service organizations identified the aging workforce as a potential threat to their field service organizations and 56% of those companies are implementing remote assistance technologies to help address it. Bridge the Skills Gap with Remote Support Remote assistance technology allows technicians who are approaching retirement age to stay in the workforce longer and empowers them to help onboard new technicians more quickly by working together to solve problems. Research shows technicians prefer to learn from each other, and remote support provides opportunities for more mentoring and camaraderie.

One of the world\u2019s most important coffee roasters and a global enterprise with products and distributors in more than 140 countries, Lavazza Group is accelerating its use of virtual assistance technologies to support the ongoing expansion of its product portfolio and continued efforts to become more responsive to fast-changing consumer needs. \u201c We are proud to partner with Lavazza Group to provide global service solutions for easier and faster product maintenance and repair, \u201d said Thomas Cottereau, founder and CEO of SightCall. \u201c Now more than ever, the world\u2019s top brands are turning to digital support that allows them to provide issue resolution with minimal service disruption. SightCall will enable Lavazza to work through customer care issues immediately, maintaining their hard-earned reputation for high-quality coffee products. \u201c SightCall provides the company with a comprehensive visual support tool for customer service agents to guide customers to troubleshoot issues, such as descaling coffee machines or basic accessory maintenance remotely. The AR interface lets remote agents draw, point and highlight onto the customer\u2019s smartphone, and high-definition picture assures the highest call qualities even in low-bandwidth environments. Device-agnostic, SightCall performs on a range of user products from smartphones and tables to specialist equipment such as smart glasses. Lavazza Group, with more than 4,000 employees and revenues of more than EUR 2 billion (2020 Financial Statement), switched to SightCall from a previous visual assistance provider. This decision stemmed from its desire to move from a local approach to a global template offering maximum portability and seamless CRM integration, reinforced by strong GDPR compliance. Lavazza first piloted SightCall with its customer service teams in France and Germany in the middle of the COVID-19 lockdown in April. Customer support teams were impressed by the ease of use and the level of confidence quickly developed with the tool, providing them with good insight into how a long-term partnership would work.

SightCall enables Peak Scientific to deliver its industry-leading Visual Support offering remote technical assistance to customers using their generators as well technicians servicing generators in the field. \u201cService is a top priority for Peak Scientific. Offering Visual Support via the SightCall application will close the distance between us and our global customer base, allowing us to accurately diagnose problems remotely and support on-site technicians. During the test period alone, we\u2019ve achieved a 97% first-time fix rate.\u201d Mike Hughes, Global Service Delivery Manager, Peak Scientific. Customers who contact the technical support desk for service questions can now be seamlessly routed to a SightCall video session that is integrated into Peak Scientific\u2019s Zendesk customer service platform. Service agents leverage this remote support capability to triage, diagnose, and troubleshoot issues with reliable HD video and a robust AR and AI feature set. For Peak Scientific, remote diagnosis is a key element of introducing Visual Support using SightCall. If a service issue requires in-person service from a Field Service Engineer (FSE), the insights and documentation from the visual support session ensures correct diagnoses of the problem as well ensuring any specialized parts or tools needed to ensure a first-time fix can be ordered and shipped in advance. If the problem is unusual or highly technical, the FSE can use SightCall to connect with a technical specialist while onsite for better support and guidance. By partnering with SightCall to deliver Visual Support, Peak Scientific has been able to maintain business continuity, improve customer service, and deliver the technology and resources their engineers need to complete their tasks effectively. Adoption and feedback from FSEs and customers has been incredibly positive, with over 97% of customers that used SightCall saying it was helpful, easy to use, and they would use it again. Led by these early successes, Peak Scientific is rolling out Visual Support to its global engineer network, working in over 25 countries to deliver direct service to customers all over the world. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to partner with Peak Scientific to support their digital transformation.

Rather than using gas cylinders, Peak Scientific customers use their gas generator solutions which are a more cost-effective alternative.

Providing industry-leading analyzers performing blood coagulation testing intended to clinicians and researchers all over the world, Stago is expanding its support and maintenance system to include high-quality video assistance calls, rapidly delivering service to customers when instruments require troubleshooting or technical intervention. With SightCall-powered remote video repairs, the company will reduce maintenance pull-outs by matching an issue with the most appropriate technical expert, shortening repair timelines and returning equipment to use more quickly. \u201cAccurate diagnostics form the backbone of patient care, and SightCall is thrilled to connect the producers of such sophisticated systems to an accurate, versatile and remote service solution for its customers,\u201d said Thomas Cottereau, Founder and CEO of SightCall. \u201cEnabling Stago\u2019s experts to troubleshoot in real-time will drive greater productivity and faster problem resolution through decreased downtime, enabling labs to spend more time on the work that is most important \u2013 diagnosing conditions and finding cures.\u201d Stago specializes in diagnostic products that measure the human body\u2019s ability to prevent and stop bleeding (hemostasis), and to assess the undesirable formation of blood clots (thrombosis). SightCall enables the company to reduce in-person technician dispatches, which involve extensive travel and physical stress for workers. These on-site visits have a mixed success rate at solving problems, such as when the first technician does not have suitable expertise to resolve the issue. SightCall connects the expert to the specific troubleshooting issue, delivers a solution in hours instead of days, and generates more cost-effective operations. With the COVID-19 pandemic necessitating the implementation of remote assistance, Stago was also drawn to SightCall\u2019s rapid deployment and upscaling capabilities, its GDPR and HIPAA compliance to protect confidential customer data, and its seamless integration into Microsoft Dynamics 365 allowing for a complete view of the customer service process. After completing a successful five-country pilot in 2020, Stago will gradually deploy the service worldwide, leveraging SightCall\u2019s on-screen annotation features and smart optical character recognition in. Quickly creating a global maintenance network through smartphone-based sessions, the company targets to significantly reduce the number of field service engineer dispatches, and following a KPI analysis, it anticipates a 2-4% productivity gain from reduced downtime after further integrating the solution. Stago is focused on increasing its support team\u2019s usage of SightCall by targeting 20% of future maintenance cases to be resolved through remote visual assistance. \u201cOur goal was simple: To provide an innovative service experience that is both visually impressive and technically effective,\u201d said Nadia Kerboussa, French Hotline and Affiliate Coordination Manager at Stago. \u201cWe chose SightCall because it is a simple, efficient video tool, easy to use for our customers and our agents. Being in the healthcare industry, we also needed a secured solution compliant with major regulatory requirements worldwide.\u201d About Diagnostica Stago International, independent and privately-owned medium-size group established in 1945 in France, Stago is currently the only company in the In Vitro Diagnostics industry exclusively dedicated to the exploration of Haemostasis and Thrombosis.

We believe that this will increase the likelihood of a \u2018first-time fix\u2019 by 30%.\u201d Murphy says the business is continually looking at ways of improving their clients\u2019 operations: \u201cOur digital services solution will give owners and operators of stadia, airports, shopping centres, hospitals or town centre car parks a fast and effective way of preventing a minor disruption from becoming a costly crisis.\u201d The solution is powered by SightCall, an augmented reality (AR)-enabled visual assistance platform. It gives APT Skidata\u2019s technical teams advanced technologies including: optical character recognition for touchless data entry; an active AR interface allowing remote experts to draw, point and highlight directly onto the service engineer\u2019s smartphone; and high-definition picture and video quality, even in low-bandwidth environments. Full GDPR compliance provides additional portability, enabling secure usage everywhere the company operates.

SightCall provides feature-rich video calls to allow an expert to \u201csee what I see\u201d for remote assistance and support. Building off this industry leading visual assistance platform, the SightCall app now allows for simplified, more effective responses to work orders, leading to improved worker safety and decreased resolution times. Historically, field service has always been done on-location because there simply wasn\u2019t a way to accurately address an issue without seeing it in person. While that can be time consuming and costly in traditional scenarios, the pandemic has added an additional layer of difficulty. Working in combination with its visual assistance platform, the SightCall app enables field service agents to get the information and vision they need to remotely assess and diagnose issues and work to quickly resolve customer issues. \u201cWhile the immediate value of remote field service is worker safety, the long-term benefits, like faster resolution time and ability to handle higher task and call volumes, could alter the field service industry permanently,\u201d said Ben Pinkerton, VP of Product Marketing at SightCall. \u201cAs SightCall continues to advance what\u2019s possible with visual imagery, we have the ability to revolutionize established processes in maintenance and customer engagement that were once considered a matter of fact. Notable experiences within the SightCall app include: Field Service Offline Mode \u2013 Using the SightCall app field service workers can take photos and videos while offline, and the selected files will be automatically uploaded from their mobile device when a connection is established. When SightCall is integrated into a CRM or other systems, the files are automatically attached to the case, work order, etc. This reduces the workload for field technicians when they need to document work or perform inspections. Smart Optical Character Recognition (OCR) \u2013 Data entry can be painful and error-prone, especially when it\u2019s repetitive. With the new Smart OCR feature, the SightCall app can be used to scan documents using the camera on the mobile device. Only the relevant text on the document is extracted from the document and then automatically synchronized with an integrated system such as Salesforce. The user can create or update the record in Salesforce with a simple tap, eliminating the process of tediously typing data using a touchscreen. New User Interface \u2013 The SightCall app has been redesigned for ease of use. With more service organizations adopting video technologies to remotely perform field service work and assistance, it is critical that any technology is easy to use. With the new SightCall app onboarding users is simple and straightforward. When implementing SightCall\u2019s technology, customers have seen an 81% increase in first-time fix success rate, eliminating the need to send a technician onsite and reducing unnecessary truck rolls. According to the Technology & Services Industry Association, the cost of a truck roll is around $1,000, so eliminating the risk associated with sending agents into the field can provide significant cost savings over time. The SightCall app is available for iOS and Android. For more information visit https://sightcall.com/.

To further their mission to eliminate barriers for passengers with disabilities, this initiative implements technology solutions that build on existing features like route planning and pre-scheduled support. By adding visual assistance, powered by SightCall, passengers, no matter their circumstances, can get immediate assistance while traveling with anything from reading signs and planning routes to confirming schedules and verifying their location. \u201cWe\u2019re committed to making transport accessible for all and this investment, along with the Inclusive Transport Strategy, will build a better, fairer network for the future.\u201d \u2013 Chris Heaton-Harris Accessibility Minister The Department for Transport recognizes that there are 13.9 million people with disabilities in the UK who need convenient access to travel for work, leisure, and daily life.

A large-scale digital health study by the American Medical Association showed that between 2016 and 2018, the percentage of physicians employing telehealth visits and remote monitoring had doubled from 14% to 28%. Unofficial estimates, including those by the AMA, put that figure as high as 90% now. Before and during the pandemic, patients reported high satisfaction with their telehealth experience, even those using it for the first time \u2013 and it\u2019s obvious why. They are afforded easy, same-day appointments with their providers and fast access to diagnoses and prescriptions, all from the comfort of their homes. Patients have been overwhelmingly receptive to this digital shift as a result. But why can\u2019t the same be said of their providers? In fact, a growing number of voices have observed that, ever since telehealth emerged, physicians experiencing information overload often found the transition to more virtual visits too demanding. Recently, Salesforce\u2019s chief medical officer Ashwini Zenooz penned an article for the Harvard Business Review. She stated that many physicians remained skeptical about virtual care and doubtful of its overall benefits, due to the perceived potential of \u201cadding to their already weighty technological and administrative burdens.\u201d Many feel an unpleasant sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, seeing another well-intentioned but negatively disruptive technological solution. The drive to adopt electronic health records a few years back, which produced record physician burnout, is still fresh on many minds. But the transformative power of telehealth can be maintained in two rather simple ways. First, providers report the greatest satisfaction with tools that are directly responsive to their needs. In other words, customization is a must-have. Telehealth also needs to augment a physician\u2019s experience of providing care and be respectful of the time and pressures they face, without replacing their services or making administrative tasks more difficult. Only then can telehealth prove to be a practical reality, rather than an abstract, distant concept. Thanks to omni-channel integration with Salesforce Health Cloud and other innovative capabilities, SightCall has responded to the demand of providers searching for a comprehensive solution. The device-agnostic platform featuring augmented reality (AR) and artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities is operated through the Salesforce patient portal, with no need for toggling between screens while guiding patients through solutions in real-time or additional administrative work related to adding and storing patient information or data. This can even be operated from a patient\u2019s mobile device \u2013 and in situations where someone who is seriously ill cannot set up a SightCall session themselves, activated without any need for input from the patient. The platform readily facilitates fully HIPAA-compliant visual assistance use cases and is also compatible with data protection and user privacy regulations like GDPR and CCPA. Providers use tools like Smart Optical Character Recognition, which collects and feeds data straight into the Salesforce patient portal using the device\u2019s camera. They can draw and pinpoint on the patient\u2019s device with SightCall\u2019s AR-driven annotation feature. Providers or patients can also be anywhere, regardless of network reception or bandwidth, and count on reliable video and call quality every time. The latter-mentioned tools only scratch the surface of SightCall\u2019s benefits. Because customers can use the solution how and when they want and need it, it facilitates seamless and rapid upscaling of telehealth calls in offices that previously used them on a sporadic basis. Data also points to marked increases in patient satisfaction scores in a matter of weeks after launching SightCall. Particularly in the past several months, customers have used SightCall as vehicles for customized remote care programs, from \u201ctele-triage\u201d processes in emergency departments to virtual facility rounds with cart-mounted cameras in critical care units, and the creation of overflow units in hospital and clinic areas remotely monitored by physicians and nurses. One major regional hospital employing it for COVID-19 screenings found the data collected during SightCall sessions essential for efforts to expand preventative care and outreach to vulnerable populations, expanding its community impact well into the future beyond the pandemic. One point that Salesforce\u2019s Dr. Zenooz made was how vital \u201chuman-centered designs\u201d are to mutually effective telehealth solutions. In many ways, this is precisely what SightCall provides. Telehealth is the direction of travel, and we are honored by the opportunity to make the continued expansion of remote medical services a smooth journey \u2013 particularly for our healthcare heroes.

TOMRA Visual Assist is TOMRA Food\u2019s new Augmented Reality tool that enables remote experts to provide specialist support to a customer or a TOMRA Field Service Engineer on-site \u2013 just as if they were standing in front of the machine. It enables TOMRA to solve a broader range of problems of varying degrees of complexity remotely. The result is more uptime and better machine performance for the customers. It also reduces the need for in-person visits. This advantage is particularly valuable in addressing the travel restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic and ensuring food safety in this situation. \u201cFast response time is critical for our customers, who deal mostly in perishable goods,\u201d explains Andreas Reddemann, VP and Head of Global Service at TOMRA Food, Aftermarket & Service. \u201c Machine downtime for them may result in a deterioration in the quality of their product. During the harvesting season, they receive a constant flow of material and have to process high volumes, so uptime is vital. That\u2019s why, at TOMRA Food, we have an ongoing focus on responding as fast as possible and in a way that is practical for them. When you have such a diverse geographic spread of customers as we have, it is not always possible to have the right Field Service Engineer immediately on site. TOMRA Visual Assist addresses this gap between being advised of an issue and being able to be there to support physically.\u201d Easy to use, no equipment or training needed; on-the-spot resolution TOMRA Visual Assist is very easy to use and requires no equipment other than a mobile phone with a camera. When the customer requests support through a message, email, or phone call, the TOMRA Field Service Engineer sends an invitation to initiate the session. When the app opens, it seamlessly links through to a call with the TOMRA expert best suited to help them with the specific challenge they are facing. When connected, they communicate through voice and video. The Field Service Engineer can direct the customer to point the camera of their mobile phone to show what they need to see. With TOMRA Visual Assist, they can also share with the customer documents and annotate images to explain and clarify directions. TOMRA\u2019s choice of technology also enables the use of advanced tools such as Smart Glasses, which provide an Augmented Reality remote intervention that leaves the customer technician or Field Service Engineer on-site with their hands free to operate with maximum safety. \u201cTOMRA Visual Assist enables a greater level of clarity in the communication and information transfer between the person on-site and the expert providing guidance remotely. It acts as the local eyes of the remote TOMRA expert,\u201d says Andreas Reddeman. \u201cWith this tool, the customer\u2019s technician gets the support they need to resolve the issue immediately, bringing the machine back in operation. If a repair requires replacing a part, TOMRA\u2019s expert can easily identify it and ensure the right spare is sent, increasing the first-time fix rate.\u201d Mobilizing TOMRA\u2019s global expertise to maximize machine uptime TOMRA Visual Assist also connects TOMRA\u2019s experts on specific applications or technical issues with the Field Service Engineer on site. This enables the Field Service Engineers to quickly resolve a broad range of issues with the expert\u2019s additional support. \u201cWith TOMRA Visual Assist, our most skilled and experienced staff can spread their knowledge more broadly than they ever could if they had to travel to every site,\u201d says Andreas Reddemann. \u201cFor example, once a Field Service Engineer has completed maintenance on a machine, they can connect to our technical expert who knows the customer\u2019s application and the mapping profiles of their product. This will help the on-site Field Service Engineer ensure the appropriate grading profile of that specific product.\u201d TOMRA Assist: services designed to deliver fast and effective support TOMRA Assist also includes three other types of support: TOMRA Assist 24/7 (telephone and email support); proactive support through the real-time monitoring features of the recently launched TOMRA Insight cloud-based service and TOMRA Remote Assist, which enables TOMRA service engineers to log into the customer\u2019s machine remotely. TOMRA\u2019s wide-ranging and expanding digital offering TOMRA Assist is part of TOMRA Food\u2019s extensive offering of digital services that cover the full customer journey: service support with TOMRA Care, training with TOMRA Academy, remote assistance with TOMRA Assist, testing and demonstrations through TOMRA Explore, education through TOMRA Talks, and connected services through TOMRA Insight.

With this partnership, TMNF adjusters can now handle insurance claims remotely during times of disaster, sharing high resolution audio and video between disaster sites and remote TMNF offices. Over SightCall\u2019s secure, stable platform, adjusters can provide an immediate damage assessment and faster payments for TMNF customers. When typhoons or heavy rains occur in Japan, insurance company assessors and/or damage appraisers generally have to carry out field surveys or document surveys to estimate what damage can be covered by the policy. The time it takes to pay out a claim is largely dependent on obtaining customer documentation, determining if a field survey is required and executing an onsite visit. However, during large scale disasters, such as earthquakes and tsunamis, a more efficient process is required to deal with the higher volume of claims. SightCall enables TMNF to immediately deploy remote adjusters who can confirm and document damage through live, AR-powered video claims. \u201cDue to Japan\u2019s proximity to the Pacific Ocean\u2019s Ring of Fire, the country has been greatly affected by some of the worst natural disasters of the 21 st century. SightCall makes it possible for TMNF to connect their customers and agents at the disaster site with their experts at the office so that they can accurately confirm the damage in real-time, without making the customer wait for field visits or go through the process of resubmitting documentation,\u201d stated Alex Leroux, MD Asia, Middle East & Africa at SightCall. \u201cWe are deeply honoured to partner with TMNF in the digital transformation of their disaster response and to provide them with a stable and secure communication platform that will help them respond quickly to their customers in times of need.\u201d This is a first step and both parties are looking forward to expanding the use of SightCall to other areas of the business and leveraging SightCall\u2019s integration capabilities with TMNF\u2019s claims system, and also AI technology, to continue to innovate and transform TMNF\u2019s claims process. TMNF and SightCall current Use Cases Include: Flooding: TMNF will be able to identify the origin and the scale of damage and immediately confirm what is covered by the insurance policy. Earthquakes: TMNF employees in affected areas will be able to use SightCall to witness operations on the ground, assess the damage faster and ensure customers are compensated faster. Water Leakage: TMNF will use SightCall to quickly and accurately determine the scale of damage and the origin of the issue. General Inspection: For a wide range of accidents, TMNF will use SightCall to compare the damage onsite with documents sent by customers, making it no longer necessary to request additional photos or documentation.

The partnership will bring the augmented reality (AR) functionalities of SightCall\u2019s Video Assistance to Coresystems\u2019 field service solution, allowing for field technicians to leverage augmented remote guidance from off-site experts. The continued growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) is driving the need for service technicians with more technical expertise than ever before. Indeed, in a recent study from The Service Council, 68 percent of respondents attributed the increasing complexity of service products as a driving trend toward AR solutions. As a result, there are fewer expert technicians who are able to meet customers\u2019 growing expectations with more complex issues, which then leads to longer travel times for each technician. As the IoT accelerates customers\u2019 awareness of service needs and maintenance, this exacerbates the wait time between issue detection and resolution. With the Coresystems-SightCall integration, service technicians no longer need to rely solely on phone calls or service ticket details to determine the root cause of an issue. Through this integration, technicians can now use augmented video assistance in a comprehensive field service management platform to better understand the scope of work long before stepping foot on-site, thus improving first-time fix rates and decreasing onsite visit duration. \u201cThe real-time connectivity of the IoT in a mobile-first world has conditioned customers to expect faster service than ever before, putting pressure on technicians who rely on traditional service methods for issue detection, such as phone calls and/or service tickets,\u201d said Thomas Cottereau, CEO of SightCall. \u201cOur partnership with Coresystems aligns perfectly with our solutions, as the coupling of our AR-powered Video Assistance with Coresystems\u2019 crowdsourcing FSM platform provides enterprises and consumers with a rich service experience the moment they need it.\u201d Key features of the Coresystems-SightCall integration include: Pre-service review: SightCall\u2019s video assistance applies from the beginning of the service request process, and the customer can connect with the technician via video through the Coresystems platform to determine the issue to be resolved. The technician can then use the video assistance to determine the scope of work, the tools needed for installation/repair, and how much time will be needed for the project. On-site support: For more technically complicated issues, on-site technicians can bring in support from off-site experts using SightCall\u2019s Video Assistance in Coresystems\u2019 platform. An SMS link will give the off-site experts direct access to interact with the on-site technician\u2019s camera screen, allowing them to provide on-screen assistance with zoom, remote annotations, HD pictures, and live pointer features. Post-work verification, assistance, and training: Technicians can review recorded SightCall Video Assistance inspections for validation, maintenance, and remote diagnosis in Coresystems\u2019 platform. The remote assistance capabilities drive efficiency in training processes as well, reducing travel costs for remote experts and providing a robust, interactive training experience for technicians. \u201cTwo key drivers for an optimal field service experience are first-time fix rate and duration of on-site visits,\u201d said Manuel Grenacher, CEO of Coresystems. \u201cThe Coresystems-SightCall integration uses the latest advancements in video and augmented reality functionalities to set the standard for those two criteria. Customers can expect faster issue detection and problem resolution from start to finish, resulting in better customer satisfaction and loyalty overall.\u201d The Coresystems-SightCall integration is currently available to customers. Coresystems will showcase demonstrations of the technology at TSC Symposium in Chicago on Sept. 11-13, 2017.

The RealWear HMT-1, HMT1Z1 (Atex zone 1 version) or RealWear Navigator 500 assisted reality devices allow companies who perform inspections to be more responsive for supervision missions with their customers, improve the efficiency of their teams, increase their safety and increase the availability of experts who remain remotely. RealWear devices allow on-site workers to instantly contact remote experts to assist them on a daily basis or during an emergency intervention. When faced with situations that require a high level of expertise, thanks to the devices\u2019 built-in camera, they have the ability to contact an expert or experts who can assist them in making decisions while allowing the responder to move freely and use their hands. Previously, they had to take pictures with a phone, email them to the experts and wait for their response, which significantly lengthened inspection times. By enabling remote experts to assist field workers, it\u2019s easy to work for more customers every day while reducing your carbon footprint with remote inspection. Where a surveyor might have been stuck for an entire day performing one inspection, they can do two or more remotely. This reduces the time required to meet customer needs. Our client Apave, an international group specializing in risk management for 150 years, testifies to the benefits of our assisted reality solution: \u201cThe project with RealWear is really beneficial for us as the use of assisted reality has enabled us to respond more quickly and efficiently to our customers\u2019 requests,\u201d explains Harold, Digital and Innovation Director of the Apave Group. \u201cWe are now more agile in the field. All we need is an internet connection and we can respond immediately with the highest possible level of expertise, regardless of location. The support of RealWear and Lunaar, who took care of the deployment, allowed us to be operational very quickly. The latter benefited in particular from the support of Lunaar, RealWear\u2019s Gold partner, which was in charge of deploying the devices as well as the associated SightCall video conferencing solution, as well as training the teams. \u201cThe use of assisted reality solutions was studied by companies before the Covid-19 pandemic, but it is clear that the pandemic has considerably accelerated the need for remote intervention capabilities,\u201d explains Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Vautel, Territory Manager Southern Europe and the Francophone Countries for RealWear. \u201cOur solution has been the answer for many companies because it is recognized as much for the technical capabilities of the devices as for their durability and adaptability to our customers\u2019 existing tools.\u201d Linkedin Youtube VISION Platform Remote Visual Support Knowledge Capture Visual AI Security VISION Platform Remote Visual Support Knowledge Capture Visual AI Security Solutions Customer Service Field Service Insurance Telehealth Solutions Customer Service Field Service Insurance Telehealth Resources Blog Podcast News Support Resources Blog Podcast News Support Company About Us Customers Contact Us Careers Company About Us Customers Contact Us Careers Get a Demo \u00a9 SightCall 2025.

Companies in the European Union are facing increasing global regulations around their environmental, social and governance (ESG) initiatives. Reporting on these sustainability goals is mandatory and businesses need to be proactive to stay compliant. Deutsche Telekom is leading the way with the help of SightCall. We\u2019re proud to say that our partnership with the largest telecommunications provider in Europe was featured in the German magazine ServiceToda y, which is published by the Service Association KVD. You can read the full article in German here. For non-German speakers and readers, here is an abbreviated English version: Deutsche Telekom Service GmbH (DTS) has approximately 30,000 employees, with a field sales force of about 8,000 who offer technical support, as well as consulting and installation services carried out on customer site. To reduce emissions and cut back unnecessary travel, DTS partnered with SightCall to make use of remote visual support solutions. SightCall\u2019s SaaS solution leverages video with AR technology and digital process automation to make the knowledge of service experts available to field services and customers in real time. In an initial pilot, the SightCall solution was used to virtually carry out on-site investigation for the installation of electric charging stations. Depending on the specific problem, expert technicians are often required to travel up to 200 kilometers to reach customers. Instead of holding the first appointment on site, during which the structural situation is inspected to determine the measures and materials required, this first inspection takes place in a video call between the technician and customer. Using integrated functionalities such as augmented reality notes, photo documentation and electronic signature, the entire process can be carried out virtually. Following the successful completion of the pilot, the SightCall solution is being applied in other use cases. It\u2019s used by service employees to remotely support customers solving problems themselves, and equally by service employees to support each other. SightCall also offers the possibility to track avoided emissions \u2013 travel time and travel costs, saved with visual assistance \u2013 which can be made transparent on a dashboard. DTS uses SightCall\u2019s Sustainability Dashboard and CO2 calculator. Using parameters such as the average fleet consumption and labor costs, and access to live traffic data, the calculator can provide a detailed overview of saved CO2 emissions and travel costs. The SightCall solution reduces the need to travel, which in turn leads to significant energy savings and reduction of carbon footprint. This results in a direct environmental advantage for DTS, in addition to improved social benefits for field service technicians who avoid unnecessary travel and stress. DTS wants to expand this use of digital and automated assistance to better leverage the knowledge of field service technicians, regardless of their location. ServiceToday is the trade magazine for decision makers from service, marketing, logistics and technology. For 30 years it has provided information on management, organization and practice in service, technical trends and their economic and organizational impact on training and staff management, about people, products and companies in the service sector.

SightCall is continuously improving its products and services to better serve its customers.

People all over the world packed movie theaters\u2026 and avoided the water. Star Wars made an even bigger splash in 1977. Every year since, Hollywood has used the sunniest season to showcase its biggest, loudest, and most spectacular movies. Here at SightCall, our Summer Release may seem low-key in comparison (no explosions, car chases or giant sharks), but if you\u2019re in search of great new features to help you deliver remarkable service? These ARE the droids you\u2019re looking for. Here are three features worth the price of admission\u2026 Agents Dashboard: Easy-to-Read Metrics Insights What It Does Provides visibility and insights for all SightCall sessions. The at-a-glance dashboard can show you how many agents are available, how many agents are active during a defined period, average call per agent and average duration per agent. Why It Matters Data helps you make better business decisions. You can monitor trends for future forecasting and planning, ensure efficient resource allocation of agents, and meet SLAs (service level agreements for service). Averages can help define what\u2019s possible with an existing service desk and can be vital when designing a roadmap of where to go next. Agents Leaderboard: Competition for Continuous Improvement What It Does Adds an element of competition. The Agent Dashboard can display Top Agents (1st, 2nd, 3rd places) and Most Improved among other metrics specific to the call agent experience. Why It Matters Gamification strategy has a positive impact on the customer service department. It can boost the motivation and engagement of customer service agents by turning their tasks into a game-like experience. Results show agent performance significantly improves using gamification, leading to faster response times, higher customer satisfaction ratings, and increased issue resolution rates. And games also encourage teamwork. Gamification can be leveraged as a great training tool by encouraging agents to exchange tips and techniques that help their colleagues \u201cup their game.\u201d ACD Priorities: Resource Allocation for Faster Response and Resolution What It Does ACD Priorities can now be configured per agent on the ACD use-case in order to set the level of an agent. This helps admins place a higher priority on certain agents or teams/groups of agents. Why It Matters: Implementing tiered levels of support using the ACD Priority feature enhances the customer experience and optimizes customer service operations. Success of such tiered support can be seen through improved efficiency, enhanced skill development and motivation, and optimized costs of resources. For managers, it allows them to provide a clear path for agents who want to \u201clevel up\u201d on the service desk. More experienced agents can transition to handling more high priority and complex calls. Want to Learn More? All these features are designed to bring more utility and clarity to your use of SightCall. We are continuously looking to improve the way you monitor and measure performance.

Even IVRs and phone calls are notoriously not a great experience. If you are expecting to turn to social media for a solution to this problem, you would not find any reliable assistance. Self-service and communities also don\u2019t answer all your questions and don\u2019t solve all your problems, but don\u2019t worry, the video movement has started. Get ready! A very well-known French retailer named Darty took time and effort to be known as \u201cle partenaire de confiance\u201d, or \u201cThe partner of trust\u201d. In France, everyone knows their Kangoos, which are never too far from you and can come help you fix all of your home appliances and electronic devices. In the past 5 years, this company was able to transform its famous quality of customer service to the digital world and online shopping wave. How did they do this? By providing you the ability to chat with one of their service specialists when you have a question or a problem? Sort of. Darty took a step further. They believed that the human relation experience they provided in-person needed to be adapted to the digital and mobile world. Customer Service With a Human Touch Two problems arise from this new anticipated method of customer service. The first problem is Darty staying in touch with its customers. How can Darty always be one touch away? Darty materialized a genius idea: The Darty Button. With a mere click of a button, you are connected with a live agent within the next 5 minutes. The second problem is Darty keeping a human relationship with its customers. It became obvious that video call was the answer they\u2019d been waiting for. But how did they make this possible? Obviously having a skype between their repair technician and their customers would not have worked. Skype is based on a network of friends that need to be connected together. Skype for Business is based on the same mechanism, but it is based around groups of colleagues and business relatives instead of friends and family. The perfect match was SightCall, a real-time video platform service providing the ability to add video into Darty\u2019s experience. For the customer, this service is simply amazing. One-touch on the Darty button (physical button or digital button) and a Darty expert pops up on your mobile screen; he\u2019s there to help you with your questions or problems. He is also equipped with his digital tools, which replace his screwdriver and hammer with the ability to see what you show him and write on your screen to guide you through your problem. Not only that, but utilizing the panel of information he has access to on his CRM, your Darty service assistant can share with you the appropriate manual right there, live on your phone. I am impressed by this amazing transformation made by Darty. I am proud that SightCall provides them the tool to make this service real. This new customer service method creates an intimate relationship between The Darty and its customers, which is just what large business corporations need to maintain their clients\u2019 satisfaction. Bravo Darty, thanks for making your customers happy by staying so close to them, even in our digital world.

With this integration, adjusters can remotely access the back camera on customers\u2019 smartphones to see the damage, take pictures, collect the evidence and produce a claim estimate in Symbility Claims Connect.

Initiated in fourth quarter of last year and accelerated by COVID-19, this alliance enables Malvern Panalytical technicians and customers to connect in a secure, virtual service environment to perform remote services that are typically handled in-person including technical repairs and equipment installations. Malvern Panalytical technicians use SightCall\u2019s live video platform to share expertise and guidance with customers, reducing the need to travel or come into direct physical contact during the service process. Customers use their cell phone or tablet to give the technician a clear view of the issue that they are facing. The Malvern Panalytical technician can guide the customer through a repair by using augmented reality tools to provide concise instructions. If an issue cannot be solved remotely, SightCall is used to thoroughly investigate the issue before dispatching a qualified technician to the field. Adding visual support to the service process eliminates repeat visits, improves repair times and enables safe pre- and self-install, while providing a better customer experience. \u201cAugmented reality has been in our road map since before the pandemic and COVID-19 created a momentum that accelerated adoption and reinforced the value of visual support,\u201d stated Richard Hulsbeek, Customer Services Director for the Tech centers at Malvern Panalytical. \u201cOur relationship with SightCall enabled us to respond quickly to ensure business continuity for the global network of scientists and engineers that rely on Malvern Panalytical technologies for essential material analysis in their manufacturing facility or research lab.

What Is a Video Platform as a Service? First of all, I would like to better define the Video PaaS (Platform as a Service) Market. So, what exactly is this new animal? First, let\u2019s define what it is not: It does not include traditional video conferencing infrastructures such as Cisco, Lifesize or Polycom It does not include internal communication solutions such as Microsoft Lync renamed Skype for business It does not include cloud-based conferencing solutions such as Webex, Go2meeting, Zoom or BlueJeans Secondly, let\u2019s figure out what it is made of: Wikipedia defines Platform as a Service (PaaS) as \u201ca category of cloud computing services that provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure typically associated with developing and launching an app.\u201d In our context, Video Communications PaaS are cloud platforms delivering a set of APIs, SDKs and connectors allowing customers to integrate video communications into their software environment. These platforms manage and hide the complexity of real time communication to make customization and integration of video capabilities easy into any app and business process. The Difference Between PaaS and SaaS For Video Communications What are the benefits of PaaS video communication versus an enterprise Software as a Service (SaaS)? Wikipedia describes Software as a Service as \u201ca software licensing and delivery model in which software is licensed on a subscription basis and is centrally hosted. It is sometimes referred to as \u201con-demand software\u201d.\u201d SaaS video communication vendors deliver standalone applications that users can log in to communicate via audio and video. Conversely, PaaS vendors provide the ability to augment existing business applications with video as part of the flow. Let\u2019s take the example of a customer service implementation. Customer service agents are connected to their agent console that is connected to their CRM. They have a single interface they use all day long. Leveraging a PaaS video solution, this interface can be augmented with live video, empowering service agents with the ability to see what their customer see right in their agent console. In addition to the ease of use for the agents, logs, recordings, analytics are all plugged with the CRM in use by the organization. To the 3 segments identified by IDC, \u201cCommunication and Collaboration\u201d as well as \u201cEducation, social and media\u201d are standard and traditionally in use. The third one named \u201cshow me\u201d is fairly new from an analyst perspective. The definition of this new category could be \u201cthe conduct of a live video session allowing two or more individuals based in different locations to collaborate together while seeing what one of the individual of the session sees\u201d. Retailers and Insurers at The Forefront of Video PaaS Adoption At SightCall we simply call it \u201csee what I see\u201d or \u201csee what your customers see\u201d. To make it very concrete, here are two examples of the SightCall Video PaaS implementation: SightCall used by Darty, a French retailer that can be compared to Best Buy in the US SightCall used by Axa, one of the top 3 global insurance company As you can see in these 2 implementations, Darty and Axa both implemented a \u201cShow me\u201d use case: Axa transformed the claims process by enabling their customers to show damage in real-time replacing the need to wait for an adjuster to come on-site. Darty transformed the customer service experience by seeing their customers\u2019 questions or problems and guiding them remotely to avoid unnecessary product returns or technician dispatch It makes complete sense to consider that among markets leveraging video PaaS, the show me market will be the fastest-growing market in the coming 5 years. In a mobile world, consumers don\u2019t consume services and goods in physical places but in digital marketplaces. The services provided by brands, manufacturers, carriers, retailers shall evolve the same way. Why would you bring your printer back to the store to find out if it can be repaired or replaced when someone could diagnose the issue remotely, and eventually show you how to repair it in a few minutes? The technology is ready and everything leads to believe that the transformation will happen quickly as customer satisfaction aligns with business efficiency. Here are a few other signs to support my remarks: Five9 Summer Release 2016 enhanced its omnichannel capabilities with the easy escalation from one channel to another including text chat to video chat using SightCall PaaS Video. The Show me use case is even going further than the ability to see by empowering customer care agents with the ability to remotely guide customers. Agents can: Zoom to have a better view of the matter without asking the customer to go to the exact distance he needs to have a good view Activate the smartphone\u2019s flashlight to highlight dark areas Pause the video and draw on the screen to explain what to do Take pictures remotely to document a case Share technical documentation while seeing the phone\u2019s screen Knowing that a picture is worth a hundred words and a video is worth a thousand pictures I let you do the math to get a sense of the benefits video brings to the business to customer\u2019s interactions! Multichannel already embraced voice, text, and social media. The next big medium is video and enterprises can embrace it with a video PaaS. IDC report is available here.
